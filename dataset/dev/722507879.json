    "DOJ Unseals Indictment Involving Uranium One Scandal\n\nThis report was originally published by Tyler Durden at Zero Hedge\nThe Department of Justice unsealed an 11-count indictment on Friday to a former DoD intelligence analyst-turned uranium transportation executive who stands accused of a bribery and money laundering scheme involving a Russian nuclear official connected to the Uranium One deal.",
    "\nThe indictment corroborates a November report by The Hill that an FBI mole deeply embedded in the Russian uranium industry had gathered extensive evidence of the scheme.",
    "\nMark Lambert, 54, of Mount Airy, Maryland, was charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and to commit wire fraud, seven counts of violating the FCPA, two counts of wire fraud and one count of international promotion money laundering.",
    "\nThe charges stem from an alleged scheme to bribe Vadim Mikerin, a Russian official at JSC Techsnabexport (TENEX), a subsidiary of Russia\u2019s State Atomic Energy Corporation and the sole supplier and exporter of Russian Federation uranium and uranium enrichment services to nuclear power companies worldwide, in order to secure contracts with TENEX.",
    "\nAccording to the indictment, beginning at least as early as 2009 and continuing until October 2014, Lambert conspired with others at \u201cTransportation Corporation A\u201d to make corrupt and fraudulent bribery and kickback payments to offshore bank accounts associated with shell companies, at the direction of, and for the benefit of, a Russian official, Vadim Mikerin, in order to secure improper business advantages and obtain and retain business with TENEX.",
    "\n\u2013DOJ\nWhile the indictment lists Lambert\u2019s company as \u201cTransportation Corporation A,\u201d a simple search reveals that Lambert is the co-President of DAHER-TLI, \u201cthe leading front end freight forwarding company dedicated to Nuclear Cargo,\u201d according to its website.",
    "\nIn 2012, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission sent a letter to Lambert with findings that TLI had exported plutonium \u201cin excess of the maximum quantity and type applied for and licensed,\u201d and \u201cexported Australian obligated material, which was not authorized under license conditions.\u201d\nPrior to his 26 year tenure in the transportation industry \u2013 20 of which have been with TLI, Mr. Lambert was an Arabic Linguist for the Navy for five years, and a Senior Intel Analyst for the Department of Defense (DoD) for three years.",
    "\nLambert also speaks fluent Arabic and Farsi (Persian), along with French and Italian.",
    "\nThe indictment against Lambert corroborates prior reporting by The Hill that an FBI mole buried deep within the Russian nuclear industry had gathered extensive evidence of a scheme involving bribes and kickbacks between Russian nuclear officials and TLI \u2013 which would have transported the U.S. uranium sold to Russia in the \u201920 percent\u2019 Uranium One deal.",
    "\n\u201cThe Russians were compromising American contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats, all of which raised legitimate national security concerns.",
    "\nAnd none of that evidence got aired before the Obama administration made those decisions,\u201d a person who worked on the case told The Hill, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by U.S. or Russian officials.\u201d\nBased on what the FBI knew \u2013 including evidence which purportedly includes a video of Russians preparing briefcases of bribe money \u2013 the Uranium One deal never should have gone through.",
    "\nMoreover, both Robert Mueller and current deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein were directly involved \u2013 and current Attorney General Jeff Sessions and other Justice Department officials appear to be covering for them.",
    "\nIn short, the FBI had ample evidence of the Russian bribery plot before the Obama administration approved the Uranium One deal thanks to their embedded mole in the Russian nuclear industry.",
    "\nThe informant \u2013 outed as energy consultant William Campbell \u2013 was \u201cthreatened\u201d by Obama admin AG Loretta Lynch to keep quiet with an iron-clad gag order, according to his attorney \u2013 former Reagan Justice Dept.",

    "\nAfter Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-VA) demanded Campbell be allowed to testify in front of Congress, the gag order was lifted.",
    "\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions originally tried to claim that there was no connection between Uranium One and the nuclear transport bribery case, however several congressional republicans pushed back:\n\u201cAttorney General Sessions seemed to say that the bribery, racketeering and money laundering offenses involving Tenex\u2019s Vadim Mikerin occurred after the approval of the Uranium One deal by the Obama administration.",
    "\nBut we know that the FBI\u2019s confidential informant was actively compiling incriminating evidence as far back as 2009,\u201d Rep. Ron DeSantis, (R-Fla.) told The Hill.",
    "\n\u201cIt is hard to fathom how such a transaction could have been approved without the existence of the underlying corruption being disclosed.",
    "\nI hope AG Sessions gets briefed about the CI and gives the Uranium One case the scrutiny it deserves,\u201d added DeSantis, whose House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittees is one of the investigating panels.",
    "\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) sent a similar rebuke last week to Rosenstein, saying the deputy attorney general\u2019s first response to the committee \u201clargely missed the point\u201d of the congressional investigations.",
    "\n\u201cThe essential question is whether the Obama Justice Department provided notice of the criminal activity of certain officials before the CFIUS approval of the Uranium One deal and other government decisions that enabled the Russians to trade nuclear materials in the U.S,\u201d Grassley scolded.\u201d\nMeanwhile, journalists John Solomon and journalist Sara Carter claim to have copies of the FBI informant\u2019s evidence, while Carter issued an explosive report in late November laying out the players, the timeline, and the evidence at hand.",
    "\n\u201cBy the time the sale of Uranium One was approved by the Obama Administration, the FBI\u2019s investigators had already gathered substantial evidence and the bureau was also aware of Russia\u2019s intentions to enter the U.S. energy market and its desire to purchase a stake in American uranium,\u201d Carter writes.",
    "\nHighlights:\nFBI mole William Campbell was a highly valued FBI asset \u2013 paid $51,000 by FBI officials at a celebration dinner in Chrystal City, VA, where Campbell\u2019s attorney says they thanked him for his service.",
    "\nCampbell was required by the Russians, under threat, to launder large sums of money \u2013 which allowed the FBI to uncover a massive Russian \u201cnuclear money laundering apparatus\u201d\nCampbell collected over 5,000 documents and briefs over a six year period\nCampbell uncovered a Russian plot to penetrate the Obama administration and gain approval for the Uranium One sale, including a 2010 email which describes \u201cRussia\u2019s intent on expanding its Uranium expansion in the United States.\u201d\n\u201cThis is not just about bribery and kickbacks but about a U.S. company that was transporting yellow-cake for the Russians with our approval,\u201d an unnamed U.S. Intelligence official told Carter, adding \u201cThis should raise serious questions.",
    "\nAt the time everyone was concerned about Russia\u2019s ties to Iran, we still are.",
    "\nAnd of course, Russia\u2019s intentions and reach into the U.S. energy market.\u201d\nGiven Friday\u2019s unsealed indictment, however it looks like the DOJ may have changed their tune on Campbell.",
    "\nIf so, perhaps that \u201cbriefcase full of bribe money\u201d video will finally see the light of day."

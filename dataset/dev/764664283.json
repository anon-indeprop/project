    "\nWills never mentions Qur\u2019an 9:29, which commands Muslims to wage war against Jews and Christians and subjugate them as inferiors under the rule of Sharia.",
    "\nWills is no more trustworthy when he deals with the question of violence in the Qur\u2019an.",
    "\nHe renders one key passage in this way: \u201cFight then until there is no more persecution, and worship [at the shrine] is devoted to God\u201d (2:193; p. 133).",
    "\nWhence the bracketed interpolation \u201cat the shrine\u201d?",

    "\nWills concludes: \u201cThe Qur\u2019an is not as absolute as this, because it always leaves room for God\u2019s inexhaustible mercy and forgiveness\u201d (p. 126).",
    "\nThat sounds wonderful, and certainly pleasing to multicultural ears to learn that the Qur\u2019an is more merciful than the New Testament.",

    "\nThis passage envisions some of the disbelievers becoming Muslim, and then turning away again, whereupon the Muslims are told to \u201ckill them wherever you find them.\u201d God\u2019s inexhaustible mercy, indeed.",
    "\nWills\u2019 peaceful fantasy Qur\u2019an raises one massive question that the author does not and cannot answer: if the Islamic holy book is really as peaceful and benign as Garry Wills makes it out to be, why do so very many Muslims worldwide misunderstand it?",
    "\nThe Islamic State (ISIS), in its heyday, quoted the Qur\u2019an frequently -- odd behavior if the group actually was ignorant of, indifferent to, or in violation of the book\u2019s core tenets.",
    "\nISIS quoted the Qur\u2019an extensively in threats to blow up the White House and conquer Rome and Spain; in explaining its priorities in the nations it is targeting in jihad; in preaching to Christians after collecting the jizya (a Qur\u2019an-based tax, cf.",
    "\nQur\u2019an 9:29); in justifying the execution of accused spies; and in its various videos.",
    "\nISIS also awarded $10,000 prizes and sex slaves in Qur\u2019an memorization contests.",
    "\nOne of its underground lairs was found littered with weapons and copies of the Qur\u2019an.",
    "\nChildren in the Islamic State study the Qur\u2019an and get weapons training.",
    "\nOne Malaysian Muslim said that the Qur\u2019an led him to join the Islamic State.",
    "\nA Muslima in the U.S. promoted the Islamic State by quoting the Qur\u2019an.",
    "\nAn Islamic State propagandist\u2019s parents said of him: \u201cOur son is a devout Muslim.",
    "\nHe had learnt the Quran by heart.\u201d A Muslim politician from Jordan said that the Islamic State\u2019s \u201cdoctrine stems from the Qur\u2019an and Sunnah.\u201d\nHow would Garry Wills explain all that?",
    "\nHe can\u2019t; he has just explained all Qur\u2019anic violence and intolerance away, leaving the manifest fact that all too many Muslims worldwide think that the Qur\u2019an says exactly what he claims it does not say an unanswered conundrum.",
    "\nWills\u2019 na\u00efve, inaccurate, misleadingly sunny view of the Qur\u2019an, of course, accords with that of his fellow Leftist Catholic, Pope Francis.",
    "\nFrancis has proclaimedpreposterously that \u201cauthentic Islam and the proper reading of the Koran are opposed to every form of violence.\u201d Wills\u2019 book accords well with the present-day Catholic Church\u2019s head-in-the-sand posture toward Qur\u2019an-based Islamic jihad violence and the Muslim persecution of the ancient Christian communities of the Middle East.",
    "\nIt isn\u2019t remotely accurate, but it feels good, and for the Catholic and Leftist establishment today, that seems to be all that matters.",

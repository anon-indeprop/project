    "\n\nRight about now the people in the Clinton camp should be getting very nervous about the ongoing investigations into the Uranium One deal.",
    "\nWhat must be most annoying for the Clinton team is that these investigations all started as a way to undermine the Trump administration and continue to push connections between Trump and Russia.",
    "\nNow, more than a year after the investigations began, it\u2019s looking less likely than ever that President Trump did anything wrong\u2026 but the investigations seem to be zeroing in on key Clinton team members (including the Clintons themselves).",
    "\nOn Tuesday night Fox News Sean Hannity sat down to talk about the exploding scandal that is the Uranium One deal, and what it could mean for the Clinton family.",
    "\nHannity spoke with investigative reporter Sara Carter of Circa, John Solomon of The Hill, and Victoria Toensing, an attorney representing the FBI informant who allegedly possesses documents on the sale of Canadian mining company \u2018Uranium One\u2019 to Russia interests back in 2010.",
    "\nNow that the NDA (non disclosure agreement) has been lifted Circa\u2019s Sara Carter is \u201creporting that she has received a treasure trove of documents that in fact prove tonight the FBI informant has knowledge of Russia\u2019s involvement in uranium one.\u201d\nNot to be outdone, the Hill\u2019s John Solomon had found even more dirt on this ugly Clinton led deal.",
    "\nApparently, Solomon has learned that the FBI informant \u201chas evidence, was on the inside, directly from Putin\u2019s Russia, the push for nuclear fuel deals, and all the crimes we talked about, bribery, kickback, extortion, money laundering, racketeering, all knelt corroborating and will be corroborated even further.",

    "\nI mean there\u2019s over 5,000 documents which include emails, briefs, other documentation, memorandums that the informant had turned over to the FBI and Justice Department, and within these documents, it\u2019s very evident of Russia\u2019s intention to enter the American market, energy market.",
    "\nAnd their intentions to acquire uranium one.",
    "\nHANNITY: John, you go into extensive detail in a very long and hard-hitting piece tonight and revealing piece, how the FBI informant \u2014 you actually said six years, I thought he was only an informant for four years.",
    "\nHe has evidence, was on the inside, directly from Putin\u2019s Russia, the push for nuclear fuel deals, and all the crimes we talked about, bribery, kickback, extortion, money laundering, racketeering, all knelt corroborating and will be corroborated even further.",
    "\nGo into your report.",
    "\nJOHN SOLOMON, THE HILL: You know, Sara just said something about the importance of the dominance of the uranium market.",
    "\nThis is an email that the FBI has had for six years.",
    "\nIt shows that uranium one was part of a Russia strategy to control, not just benefit from the global market, controlled the global market.",
    "\nThat would put the United States at a disadvantage.",
    "\nThat is the sort of evidence that this FBI informant has right now.",
    "\nIf you go back on the last week we heard several things from the Justice Department, there\u2019s no connection to uranium one.",
    "\nThese are emails that say uranium one that are in the FBI files.",
    "\nThey said that there was no connection between the uranium one case and the criminal case.",
    "\nWe now know the criminal case got its first evidence in 2009, a whole year before the uranium one deal was approved by the Obama administration.",
    "\nThere are a lot of things that people have been saying that these documents simply don\u2019t agree with.",
    "\nHANNITY: All right.",
    "\nI got a very high ranking Congressman and that knows, let us put it that way, and actually sent me a note.",
    "\nThe knowledge of key administration officials will be the next thing proven by both of you, and the links to the Clinton foundation.",
    "\nSara, is that true?",
    "\nCARTER: I believe that is true.",
    "\nI mean especially when we at \u2014\nHANNITY: Do believe or you know?",
    "\nI can\u2019t ask Victoria that question because she won\u2019t tell me.",
    "\nCARTER: I know it\u2019s true.",
    "\nI know that looking at these documents following the money, following the money is what\u2019s important here.",
    "\nThe Justice Department has not pointed out that they will possibly call a special counsel to this.",
    "\nThis is still out there.",
    "\nThey are looking into it.",
    "\nThat is something that they need to decide.",
    "\nBut whether it\u2019s a special counsel or whether it\u2019s a prosecutor that is investigating this, they will be able to follow the money.",
    "\nThere are somethings said \u2026\nHANNITY: When you say follow the money, my suspicion would go to the money came directly from Russia, was funneled through the Canadian donors to the Clinton Foundation.",
    "\nHow good are my instincts?",
    "\nCARTER: You have pretty good instincts.",
    "\nI think there\u2019s a lot of other areas that they will be looking at as well.",
    "\nRemember this is like peeling back an onion.",
    "\nYou peel one part and then you find another part.",
    "\nAnd that is what\u2019s going to require somebody to do an extensive investigation.",
    "\nHANNITY: But it is beginning to cascade Sara.",
    "\nCARTER: It is.",
    "\nHANNITY: John, I want her to respond to the same thing, that the Clinton Foundation, that this will be traced back to high-ranking Obama administration officials and the Clinton Foundation, and if you add the money portion Sara mentioned?",
    "\nSOLOMON: I do.",
    "\nI think the place we will be talking about in the next couple weeks as the Clinton global initiative.",
    "\nSort of a side project of the Clinton Foundation.",
    "\nThere are new flows of money there that we will report on then the next couple of weeks.",
    "\nThere were also some personal business projects, some very senior Clinton people that got a remarkable infusion of cash from Russia.",
    "\nIt will be able to talk about that in the next couple of weeks.",
    "\nAnother layer of interest of the story.",
    "\nHANNITY: All right.",
    "\nWe have a lot of time in the segment so I want to go very slowly here.",
    "\nBoth of you, before I get to Victoria, Sara and John, you both in your pieces said 5,000 documents.",
    "\nI hear the number the FBI informant is much, much greater, tens of thousands.",
    "\nTrue or false?",
    "\nSOLOMON: That seems to be accurate.",
    "\nWe have a subset of the documents and they are very voluminous.",
    "\nHANNITY: Now let me go to Victoria.",
    "\nOne of the great attorneys.",
    "\nShe is the most difficult to get any information out of.",
    "\nVictoria, one of the things I\u2019ve known about you, and I\u2019ve interviewed you so many times over the years, you now have been doing a deep dive into all of this.",
    "\nYou are now representing this FBI informant.",
    "\nI think they will become an American hero out of all of this, but apparently, he was fighting and begging and pleading and saying the Russians are here, they are doing this, why are you paying attention?",
    "\nI hope my instincts are right there, and number two, how devastating it legally is this going to be based on what I was just asking Sara and John about impacting former Obama officials, money, Clinton foundation?",
    "\nVICTORIA TOENSING, ATTORNEY REPRESENTING FBI INFORMANT: Let me go to number one first, that is the whole essence of what John and Sara and I are talking about is that in 2009, 2010, our FBI and presumably our Justice Department, and the White House, as my client was told, all knew about this corruption in the Russian nuclear energy area.",
    "\nThere\u2019s no separate companies.",
    "\nThey are all related.",
    "\nThe Russian nuclear energy is controlled from the top, from Putin.",
    "\nThey are all one.",
    "\nThey all talk to each other.",
    "\nSo the evidence about this corruption was known to our government in 2009, 2010, and why is it that CFIUS either wasn\u2019t told, or CFIUS people knowing about it \u2014\nHANNITY: Explain CFIUS, 13 agencies, I am sorry 9 agencies approving the deal that gave control of uranium one to the bad actor, hostile regime, Putin Russia.",
    "\nTOENSING: They said, the CFIUS board said that the bad Russians could buy uranium one, which contains access to 20 percent of the U.S.",
    "\nUranium, why was that decision made?",
    "\nWas CFIUS told?",
    "\nDid Bob Mueller go to Eric Holder and tell him?",
    "\nEric Holder sat on it.",
    "\nHANNITY: He was one of the nine.",
    "\nTOENSING: Did Bob Mueller go to the White House and tell him?",
    "\nThe FBI agents told my client that they were briefing the President about his conduct.",
    "\nOf course, when the CFIUS decision was made.",
    "\nMy client said, what happened?",
    "\nHANNITY: Back to my original question, counselor, if I may.",
    "\nYou are too good at your job.",
    "\nThis is a very serious point.",
    "\nPutting your legal hat on, objectively speaking, yes they knew, the evidence will prove it based on the documents and your client, crimes committed on a high level?",
    "\nNational security compromise?",
    "\nTOENSING: Of course, it goes without saying giving the Russians control of the uranium was a national security compromise.",
    "\nI think that we are going to have to do is continue to follow the money because the reporting that John and Sara are going to be doing in a few days will be revealing about where lots of the various money went and where it came from.",
    "\nHANNITY: Always we go back, and I believe at the end of this you guys deserve a Pulitzer, and I\u2019m not the only one thinking that.",
    "\nYou have dug so deep on this, this has been a deep dive and I applaud you both.",
    "\nI want to ask as it relates to who knew what, and when.",
    "\nWhat did they know, when did they know it, John Solomon?",
    "\nI\u2019m talking about Obama, Mueller, Eric Holder, and Hillary Clinton.",
    "\nSOLOMON: We are at a little disadvantage right now, because we don\u2019t have those records, and also the records that Congress needs to go get, but I can tell you I have a person quoted in my story who has direct knowledge of what the Justice Department knew.",
    "\nThis person said without a shred of doubt, we knew in 2009 a year before CFIUS ruled that Thomas were engaged in criminality, without a shadow of a doubt, we knew that Russia was trying to gain a corner on the U.S. market, get a strong hold on our uranium, and without a doubt we knew they were using political levers to try to get their way here.",
    "\nWe are talking about control, like this document says, they are trying to gain control of our markets.",
    "\nThat has to be national security interest that should have been raised in CFIUS.",
    "\nHANNITY: President daily briefings were told.",
    "\nHad this information in it before CFIUS approves this.",
    "\nCARTER: Sean.",
    "\nThat is what we need to find out.",
    "\nWe need to see those Presidential daily briefings.",
    "\nCongress can get those.",
    "\nThey will be able to know whether or not President Obama was briefed on this and according to a number of people that I have spoken with as well, he was.",
    "\nI think that will reveal a whole other layer of who knew what, where and when.",
    "\nAnd we follow the money and it will reveal even more about Hillary Clinton and what she knew and when did she know it, and the other members of the CFIUS board.",
    "\nHANNITY: And Obama and Holder and Mueller?",
    "\nJohn, real quick, we are running out of time.",
    "\nSOLOMON: yes listen, I think even Sessions and Rosenstein have questions to answer.",
    "\nThere are people in Congress who don\u2019t think they\u2019ve gotten a straight answer from them.",
    "\nHANNITY: All right.",
    "\nVictoria, we get the last word from you, laws broken?",
    "\nTOENSING: Well, of course.",
    "\nHANNITY: You are so good at your job.",
    "\nYou are so annoyingly good.",
    "\nThe American people deserve the truth varied our security was compromised, we import uranium, because we don\u2019t have enough.",
    "\nNewt Gingrich will weigh in on this and more things and about the Clintons.",
    "\nAre they facing their day of reckoning?",
    "\nAnd a big announcement at the end of the show.",

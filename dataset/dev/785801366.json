    "9 Steps to Successfully Counter Jihad\n\n[Pre-Order Jamie Glazov's new book, Jihadist Psychopath: How He Is Charming, Seducing, and Devouring Us, HERE.]",
    "\nEditors\u2019 note: In light of the skyrocketing phenomenon of Muslim migrants stabbing unbelievers in random stabbing sprees in Europe, as well as the calculated denial that leaders, authorities and media are enforcing about it, Frontpage has deemed it important to bring attention to the crucial steps America and the West must take to robustly confront the unceasing onslaught by Jihad and its leftist enablers.",
    "\nWe are, therefore, reprinting below Frontpage editor Jamie Glazov\u2019s July 12, 2016 Breitbart article, \"9 Steps to Successfully Counter Jihad\".",
    "\nHaving written the article in the closing chapter of the disastrous Obama administration, the author recognizes and celebrates the life-saving turn-around disposition that the Trump administration has brought in to counter Jihad.",

    "\nWe find the article more relevant and urgent than ever due to the 17th anniversary of 9/11 approaching tomorrow:\n*\n9 Steps to Successfully Counter Jihad.",
    "\nBy Jamie Glazov\nWhile the Obama administration continues to allow the Muslim Brotherhood to direct American foreign policy and, therefore, to implement \u201cstrategies\u201d that render America defenseless in the face of Jihad and stealth Jihad, there are some alternative strategies that have the potential to turn this catastrophic situation around completely in America\u2019s favor.",
    "\nBelow are 9 concrete steps that, if implemented by a future American administration, would make a big difference in preserving our civilization and in defending Americans from terrorism:\n1.",
    "\nLabel the Enemy and Make a Threat Assessment.",
    "\nThe Obama administration continues to refuse to label our enemy and, therefore, it continues to enable our defeat in the terror war.",
    "\nIt is urgent that we name our enemy (i.e.",
    "\nIslamic Jihad) and definitively identify what ideology inspires our enemy (i.e.",
    "\nIslamic law).",
    "\n2.",
    "\nScrap \u201cCountering Violent Extremism.\u201d\n\u201cCountering Violent Extremism\u201d is the pathetic and destructive focus of the Obama administration in allegedly fighting the terror war.",
    "\nOn the one hand, this \u201cfocus\u201d is vague to the point of being meaningless and completely incapacitates us.",
    "\nOn the other hand, this focus allows the administration to perpetuate the destructive fantasy that there are other types of \u201cextremists\u201d \u2014 who just happen to be the Left\u2019s political opponents \u2014 that pose a great threat to the country.",
    "\nFor example, as Stephen Coughlin has revealed, the \u201cviolent extremists\u201d the administration is clearly worried about are the \u201cright-wing Islamophobes\u201d whom the administration obviously considers to be the real threat to American security.",
    "\nThe \u201cCountering Violent Extremism\u201d is trash and needs to be thrown in the garbage.",
    "\n3.",
    "\nStop \u201cPartnering\u201d With Muslim Brotherhood Front Groups.",
    "\nThe government needs to stop cooperating with, and listening to, Muslim Brotherhood front groups such as CAIR and ISNA immediately.",
    "\nThe Muslim Brotherhood document, the Explanatory Memorandum, has made it clear that the Brotherhood\u2019s objective is to destroy our civilization from within by our own hands with the influence of these groups.",
    "\nMoreover, as Robert Spencer advises, there needs to be legislation that will bar all such groups and affiliated individuals from advising the government or receiving any grants from it.",
    "\n4.",
    "\nImplement a Concrete \u201cCountering-Jihad\u201d Strategy.",
    "\nAfter discarding the \u201cCountering Violent Extremism\u201d absurdity, a concrete Counter-Jihad strategy must become an official policy.",
    "\nIt must specifically register that Jihadists are the enemies and that Islamic law (Sharia) is what specifically motivates them.",
    "\nMost importantly, as Sebastian Gorka urges in Defeating Jihad: The Winnable War, the government needs to lay down a vision, an actual \u201cthreat doctrine analysis\u201d in a thorough document, just like George Kennan\u2019s Long Telegram and NSC-68 did in laying out the strategic foundation to fighting communism in the Cold War.",
    "\nIt is absolutely mind-boggling that nothing of this sort exists today in our terror war \u2014 and it is a reflection of the Left being in charge and of the destructive defeat that it is sowing.",
    "\n5.",
    "\nLaunch Our Own Counter-propaganda Campaign.",
    "\nThe Left and Islamists engage in propaganda 24/7.",
    "\nWhat does our propaganda war entail?",
    "\nZilch.",
    "\nSebastian Gorka is crucially correct, therefore, when he recommends a national counter-propaganda campaign that involves a two-part approach: the first being the bolstering of efforts to define our enemy (Steps #1 and #4 above) and, second, the strengthening of our allies and partners in their own counter-propaganda efforts \u2013 which must include our empowering of Muslims who are trying to form an anti-Jihadist version of Islam.",
    "\nConsequently, educational programs have to be set up everywhere, from public schools to universities to workplaces, in businesses and numerous other institutions.",
    "\nThese programs must crystallize what exactly Islamic Law is and how it inspires and sanctions violence against unbelievers.",
    "\nThis has to also involve, as Gorka urges, \u201ca nationwide program of education that includes the armed services as well as federal, state, and local police forces and the intelligence community.\u201d\nThe education campaign must also focus on the second part of Gorka\u2019s counter-propaganda campaign, which is to help strengthen Muslims who seek to seize Islam from the jihadists\u2019 hands.",
    "\n6.",
    "\nAffirm Sharia\u2019s Assault on the U.S. Constitution as Seditious.",
    "\nOnce the truth is accepted that jihadis are inspired and sanctioned by their Islamic texts, it must logically become required that mosques, Islamic schools and groups have to immediately curtail any teaching that motivates sedition, violence, and hatred of unbelievers (i.e.",
    "\nremember how CAIR advised Muslims not to talk to the FBI).",
    "\nIndeed, once the government discerns and labels the elements of Islamic law that threaten the American Constitution, any preaching and spreading of those elements in America must be labelled as seditious.",
    "\n7.",
    "\nPut Pressure on Mosques, Islamic Groups and Schools.",
    "\nAuthorities have to start subjecting mosques and other Islamic institutions to surveillance \u2014 and discard the suicidal leftist notion that it is \u201cracist\u201d and Islamophobic to do so.",
    "\nIslamic institutions have to be made to buffer their lip-service against terror with actually doing something about it.",
    "\nAs Robert Spencer counsels, this has to involve introducing programs that teach against jihadists\u2019 understanding of Islam \u2014 and these programs have to be regularly monitored by the government.",
    "\n(This will be a part of Gorka\u2019s suggested counter-propaganda campaign discussed in Step #5).",
    "\nSpencer rightly stresses that the paradigm has to become that Muslim communities have to win the \u201ctrust\u201d of intelligence and law enforcement agents, rather than the other way around, which is, absurdly and tragically, the case right now.",
    "\n8.",
    "\nBring Counter-Jihadists into the Government.",
    "\nInstead of having Muslim Brotherhood sympathizers like Mohamed Elibiary serving on the U.S.",
    "\nHomeland Security Advisory Council (he \u201cresigned\u201d in Sept. 2014 under mysterious circumstances), and Muslim Brotherhood-linked individuals like Huma Abedin serving as the right-hand woman of Hillary Clinton, we need to bring in people who actually love America and want to protect it.",
    "\nWe all know who these noble and courageous individuals are \u2013 and some of them are referenced in this article.",
    "\nThe government must also bring in brave Muslim individuals who genuinely reject Jihad and empower them in propagating their anti-jihadist vision for Islam.",
    "\n(P.S.",
    "\nYes, there is an argument to be made that Islam cannot be Islam without Jihad.",
    "\nBut the debate over this belongs in another forum.",
    "\nAnd whatever the answer, it does not mean that the effort to empower Muslims who want to make the anti-jihadist Islamic vision possible should not be made.)",
    "\n9.",
    "\nRidicule the Enemy.",
    "\nRidicule is a vicious and potent weapon.",
    "\nThere is a baffling and shameful silence in our culture\u2019s sphere of comedy, especially in Hollywood and our media, with regard to the myriad ingredients of Sharia and Jihad that merit at least a million hilarious satirical sketches.",
    "\nBill Maher, for whatever unappealing drawbacks he has in conservatives\u2019 eyes, has set a bold standard in this respect in his Burka Fashion Show skit.",
    "\nAmerican comedians need to start writing scripts that follow in Maher\u2019s footsteps and Americans need to encourage and equip them to do so \u2013 and to also vigorously defend them from the attacks and slanders they will inevitably receive from totalitarian leftist and Islamic forces.",
    "\nWe must never underestimate the crippling effect of comedy on the totalitarian Mullahs of the world.",
    "\nIndeed, the contemptuous, snickering and roaring laughter of people, as they gaze at the pathetic rules and lives of Sharia\u2019s gatekeepers, poses a danger to tyrants like no other.",
    "\nJamie Glazov holds a Ph.D. in History with a specialty in Russian, U.S. and Canadian foreign policy.",

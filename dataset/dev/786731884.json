    "\nThe book illustrates how the Jihadist Psychopath has successfully built his totalitarian plantation -- on which many in the West are now enslaved and dutifully following his orders.",
    "\nJamie outlines the frameworks of this tyrannical plantation and how those who are trapped on it, and yearn for freedom, can best escape.]",

    "\nSomewhere in the \u201ccommunity standards\u201d that Facebook demands everyone follow is a real doozy.",
    "\nThe social-media company has told author and commentator Jamie Glazov that their standards forbid his article about how to prevent jihadi attacks on Americans.",
    "\nIt\u2019s all about Glazov\u2019s new book, \u201cJihadist Psychopath: How He Is Charming, Seducing, and Devouring Us.\u201d\nAt FrontPage Magazine, where he is editor, he had posted \u201c9 Steps to Successfully Counter Jihad,\u201d which included recommendations such as \u201cLabel the enemy and make a threat assessment\u201d and \u201cStop \u2018partnering\u2019 with Muslim Brotherhood front groups.\u201d\nThat apparently was too much for Facebook, which declared \u201conly you can see this post\u201d because it \u201cgoes against our Community Standards.\u201d\nHe was suspended from Facebook for 30 days on Sept. 11, the anniversary of the Islamic jihadist attack on America that killed nearly 3,000.",
    "\nGlazov told Breitbart, \u201cThis is really getting surreal in the creepiest and most harrowing Stalinist sense.\u201d\n\nFrontPage Magazine reported:\nFacebook\u2019s Unholy Alliance masters are, without doubt, accelerating their totalitarian suffocation of free thought and expression.",
    "\nIt is no surprise, therefore, that Frontpage\u2019s editor, and host of \u2018The Glazov Gang,\u2019 was suspended from Facebook for 30 days yesterday, on September 11, after posting his article, \u20189 Steps to Successfully Counter Jihad.\u2019 Glazov believed that the article was more relevant and urgent than ever due to the skyrocketing jihadist stabbings in Europe \u2014 and to the 17th anniversary of 9/11 that was approaching the next day.",
    "\nThe report said it appears \u201cthat daring to give suggestions on how our civilization can stop jihadist attacks and another 9/11 is against Facebook\u2019s \u2018community standards.",
    "\n'\u201d\n\u201cGlazov\u2019s advice also involves the promotion of supporting moderate Muslims \u2013 a move that is, clearly, horrifying to Facebook\u2019s masters and therefore also violates their \u2018community standards,'\u201d the report said.",
    "\nNo doubt, Glazov\u2019s consistent campaigning on behalf of Muslim women and girls in his efforts to protect them from FGM, honor killings and other Shariah barbarities, has gained him the anger and hatred of Facebook\u2019s guardians \u2014 who are clearly on the side of the Shariah enforcers and oppressors of Muslim women and girls.",
    "\nThe report recalls that Facebook censored Glazov in April for posting screenshots of a Muslim\u2019s threat to him.",
    "\nTwitter also lashed out at him for quoting directly from Islamic religious texts, citing its anti-\u201chate\u201d policies.",
    "\nIt is \u2018hateful conduct,\u2019 apparently, to reference what Islamic texts themselves say.",
    "\nIndeed, Frontpage\u2019s editor had simply referred to Sahih Bukhari\u2019s texts discussing Mohammed\u2019s marriage to Aisha when she was six years old (7.62.88) and to Quranic Suras that mandate the Hijab for women (24:31; 33:59) and sanction sexual slavery (4:3; 33:50).",
    "\nFacebook also refused to respond to Glazov\u2019s inquiry about \u201cwhat it is specifically that violates Facebook\u2019s \u2018community standards\u2019 when a person gives advice on how to best defend American lives from jihad.\u201d\nGlazov has written about the subject in previous books, including \u201cHigh Noon for America: The Coming Showdown\u201d and \u201cUnited in Hate.\u201d\nIn his \u201c9 Steps\u201d article, he points out that the Obama administration was \u201ccooperating with, and listening to, Muslim Brotherhood front groups such as CAIR and ISNA.\u201d\nThe government needs, he said, to \u201cimplement a concrete \u2018countering-jihad\u2019 strategy.\u201d\nAnd he said it needs to affirm \u201cShariah\u2019s assault on the U.S. Constitution as seditious.\u201d\nA last key point, the said, is to ridicule the enemy.",
    "\nRidicule is a vicious and potent weapon.",
    "\nThere is a baffling and shameful silence in our culture\u2019s sphere of comedy, especially in Hollywood and our media, with regard to the myriad ingredients of Shariah and jihad that merit at least a million hilarious satirical sketches.",
    "\nBill Maher, for whatever unappealing drawbacks he has in conservatives\u2019 eyes, has set a bold standard in this respect in his Burka Fashion Show skit.",
    "\nAmerican comedians need to start writing scripts that follow in Maher\u2019s footsteps and Americans need to encourage and equip them to do so \u2013 and to also vigorously defend them from the attacks and slanders they will inevitably receive from totalitarian leftist and Islamic forces."

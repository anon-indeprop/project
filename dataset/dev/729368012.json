    "\nLambert and others also allegedly used code words like \u201clucky figures,\u201d \u201cLF,\u201d \u201clucky numbers,\u201d and \u201ccake\u201d to describe the payments in emails to the Russian official at his personal email account.",
    "\nThe indictment also alleges that Lambert and others caused Transportation Corporation A to overbill TENEX by building the cost of the corrupt payments into their invoices, and TENEX thus overpaid for Transportation Corporation A\u2019s services.",
    "\nIn June 2015, Lambert\u2019s former co-president, Daren Condrey, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the FCPA and commit wire fraud, and Vadim Mikerin pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering involving violations of the FCPA.",

    "\nThe indictment includes allegations against Lambert based on his role in effectuating the criminal scheme with Condrey, Mikerin, and others.",
    "\nWe also know the following about Campbell:\nUndercover FBI informant William Campbell has given written testimony to Congressional investigators after an \"iron clad\" gag order was lifted in October\nCampbell was a highly valued CIA and FBI asset deeply embedded in the Russian nuclear industry while Robert Mueller was the Director of the FBI\nwhile Robert Mueller was the Director of the FBI Campbell was required by the Russians, under threat, to launder large sums of money - which allowed the FBI to uncover a massive Russian \"nuclear money laundering apparatus \"\n\" He collected over 5,000 documents and briefs over a six year period, some of which detail efforts by Moscow to route money to the Clinton Foundation\nCampbell claims to have video evidence of bribe money related to the Uranium One deal being stuffed into suitcases.",
    "\nof bribe money related to the Uranium One deal being stuffed into suitcases.",
    "\nThe Obama FBI knew about the bribery scheme, yet the administration still approved the Uranium One deal.",
    "\nTo thank him for his service, Campbell was paid $51,000 by FBI officials at a 2016 celebration dinner in Chrystal City\nWhen it emerged that Campbell had evidence against the Clinton Foundation, a Yahoo News article by Michael Isikoff (of FISA warrant application fame) slammed Campbell as a \"disaster\" potential witness\nAll of this then goes back to things we have pointed out with ranchers in the western united States and how this impacts them, as well as the land grabs that are unconstitutionally orchestrated by the DC government and the Bureau of Land Management.",
    "\nThere is also substantial documentation that was discovered in Oregon that relates to this deal during the Oregon occupation in 2016, which got zero coverage in the mainstream media.",
    "\nAre we about to see a serious shakedown in all of this?",
    "\nTime will tell, but I remain skeptical, as in the end, all we ever get is excuses rather than justice."

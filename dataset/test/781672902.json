    "\nThe intent was to use Ukraine, a Russian province for more than three centuries, to create problems for Russia that would absorb Russia\u2019s attention and return a free hand to Washington and Israel in the Middle East and also to evict Russia from its Black Sea naval base in Crimea.",
    "\nWhen Crimeans voted to reunite with Russia, Washington misrepresented the democratic result of self-determination as a \u201cRussian invasion and annexation of Crimea.\u201d Such an extraordinary misrepresentation destroyed any remaining confidence the Russian government might have had in Washington\u2019s veracity.",

    "\nPresident Eisenhower warned the American people about this likely outcome in 1961 to no avail.",
    "\nFrom the standpoint of the military/security complex, the problem of normalizing relations with Russia is that it downgrades the \u201cRussian threat\u201d that is so essential to the $1,000 billion annual budget of the military/security complex and the power that such a massive budget conveys.",
    "\nOnly 16 countries in the world out of 195 countries have a GDP greater than $1,000 billion.",

    "\nAfter two years the only evidence we have of Russiagate is that it is a conspiracy against President Trump and the American people.",
    "\nIndeed, Mueller, fully aware that there was no Trump-Putin conspiracy, has not bothered to look for any evidence as there can be no evidence of something that did not happen.",
    "\nHe pulled out of a hat some phony and meaningless indictments of some Russians in order to make it look like there was a conspiracy without having to prove it, but his main focus has been on framing Paul Manafort.",
    "\nMueller\u2019s investigation of Manafort has nothing to do with the Russiagate story line.",
    "\nManafort\u2019s alleged crimes are far outside Mueller\u2019s mandate and took place, if they did, years before the alleged events of Russiagate.",
    "\nManafort\u2019s conviction by a jury on 8 of the 18 counts is being misrepresented by the Trump-hating presstitutes as vindication of the Russiagate investigation and as \u201cA dark day for Trump,\u201d with the presstitutes suggesting a Watergate parallel that will force Trump from office.",
    "\nManafort was found guilty not of Russiagate, but of income tax evasion and misrepresenting his financial position on a loan application.",
    "\nWe do not know if Manafort is guilty or is simply a victim of Mueller\u2019s frameup and an incompetent jury.",
    "\nAmerican juries are notoriously incompetent, which is why 97% of felony indictments are settled with a plea bargain.",

    "\nInstead of prosecution, Washington relied on the Federal Reserve to bail out the banks holding the misrepresented loans.",
    "\nIncome tax invasion is the purview of the IRS, not of a special prosecutor who is supposed to be looking for evidence of a Trump-Putin conspiracy.",
    "\nThe Russia Hoax: The I... Gregg Jarrett Best Price: $13.99 Buy New $12.63 (as of 08:40 EDT - Details)\nSo, why did Mueller focus on Manafort?",
    "\nLet Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz tell you:\n\u201cAll the Special Counsel needs, in order to charge a subject of an investigation with lying to a prosecutor, is a single witnesses willing to contradict the subject.",
    "\n\u201cThe witness may not only be \u201csinging,\u201d he may also be \u201ccomposing\u201d \u2014 that is, making up or embellishing a story because he knows that the better his story, the better the deal.",
    "\n\u201cUnder federal law, the testimony of such a \u201cflipped witness\u201d need not be corroborated in order to secure a conviction.",
    "\n\u201cEven one question that results in an answer that is contradicted by one witness would be enough to spring the perjury trap.\u201d\nPresident Trump has made various statements disputing the orchestrated Russiagate accusations that, if Manafort as witness for the Special Prosecutor contradicted, could send the President of the United States to prison for perjury.",
    "\nKnowing this, Mueller, in my opinion a proven corrupt person, decided to put the squeeze on Manafort in order to force Manafort to save himself by giving false testimony against Trump.",

    "\nManafort can still be coerced to say something that can be used to drive Trump from office.",
    "\nWhat about Michael Cohen, a former attorney for Trump?",
    "\nMueller saw no value in the Cohen case and passed it off to a regular US attorney to prosecute.",
    "\nTherefore, it would appear not to be part of the Russiagate investigation.",

    "\nWith regard to the campagin contributions, he contradicted his previous statements.",
    "\nHe said that on Trump\u2019s instruction, he paid off two women who were claiming sexual affairs with Trump.",
    "\nThe intricacies of American laws relating to politics are often unclear.",
    "\nApparently, the charge is that Cohen used monies raised for a political campaign to pay off two women, who saw and capitalized on an opportunity to extort Trump for money, and this was an illegal use of the money.",
    "\nWhy a lawyer would pay off women, whose stories might or might not be true, in an illegal way when his client is a multi-billionaire doesn\u2019t make much sense.",

    "\nTrump will never be forgiven for preventing the election of the first female president of the United States, an unpardonable crime by a misogynist white male who \u201cgrabs women by the pussy.\u201d\nThe hatred of Trump by the military/security complex and by the white male hating Identity Politics of the Democratic Party is giving the world the spectacle of an American democratic presidential election being overthrown by a conspiracy between the military/security complex, the Democratic Party, and the whores who constitute the American print and TV media.",

    "\nWhoever advised Trump to appoint Rosenstein, a person committed to Trump\u2019s destruction, as deputy attorney general, which is the ruling position in view of the weak and stupid AG Sessions who recused himself from the Russiagate investigation, intended Trump\u2019s destruction.",
    "\nA disreputable person committed to Trump\u2019s destruction is appointed by Trump to destroy Trump.",
    "\nHow can a person so unclued survive?",
    "\nAs I wrote during the presidential campaign, Trump has no idea of Washington and no idea who to appoint who would support him rather than work against him.",
    "\nConsequently, he has a government working against him.",
    "\nSenators John McCain and Lindsey Graham are working to prevent the Republican Party from supporting the party\u2019s president.",
    "\nThey could easily succeed.",
    "\nThe entirety of the House and Senate of both parties is in thrall to the campaign donations of the military/security complex.",
    "\nWhat can President Trump do?",
    "\nHe could fight, not with words on Twitter, but with the powers of the presidency.",
    "\nThere is far more evidence that Russiagate is a conspiracy against the President of the United States than there is evidence that it is a Trump-Putin conspiracy to steal the election from Hillary.",
    "\nIf Mueller can indict on the basis of no evidence, Trump can order the Attorney General to indict on the basis of massive evidence that Russiagate is a conspiracy against the President of the United States.",
    "\nBrennan, Comey, Clapper, Mueller, Rosenstein, McCabe, Strzok, CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, NPR, the New York Times, Washington Post, et.",
    "\nal., are all members of the conspiracy to overthrow democracy in America and establish the undisputed rule of the military/security complex.",
    "\nThe idiot presstitutes\u2019 hatred of Trump might leave them unaware of the conspiracy in which they are participating, but there is no doubt that the American presstitutes are engaged in the overthrow of American democracy, however little of American democracy still exists.",

    "\nThe entire world looks at America and Israel, and what does the world see?",
    "\nTwo countries, both the result of exterminating the native populations, distrusted and universally hated, both of which survive by purhasing the governments of other countries and by endless lies that describe everyone but themselves and their vassals as evil criminals that must be destroyed.",

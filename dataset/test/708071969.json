    "\n\u201cThe problem of plague is not just a medical response.",
    "\nYou can have hospitals but if people don\u2019t come it isn\u2019t enough.\u201d Such incidents have prompted fears that the plague could spread even further with each confirmed case requiring 20 people have been in contact with to be treated as a precaution.",

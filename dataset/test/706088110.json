    "\nHowever, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) declined to enforce those deportation orders, called Final Order Of Removal\nDuring the 10 or so years that the cases involving Indonesian Christians were free to remain in the United States, those illegal aliens did not make any effort to appeal their outstanding orders.",

    "\nThis is what\u2019s unravelling, and the stronger the push the unravel it, the stronger the reaction and response from the deep state.",
    "\nThe Takeaway\nRecognize what\u2019s happening, the massive censorship of information, coupled with the ridicule or finger pointing, or even arrest of people who choose to voice an opinion in opposition to the rhetoric that\u2019s constantly spewed by mainstream media, which in turn is usually believed by the masses.",

    "\nWe are more aware, but there is still some ways to go\u2026\nA good chunk of work has been done.",
    "\nA massive transformation of consciousness has taken place and it seems that a global mass is growing closer to a critical mass.",

    "\nIndependent media will continue to have the opportunity to share information because of a lack of credible information and plain truth within the mainstream.",
    "\nPeople are hungry for it, and will seek it out themselves.",

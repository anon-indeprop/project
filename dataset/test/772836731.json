    "\nI was working together with a staffer of the US Republican Senator from California, S. I. Hayakawa, to advance understanding of a supply-side economic policy cure to the stagflation that threatened the US budget\u2019s ability to meet its obligations.",
    "\nRepublican Senators Hatch, Roth, and Hayakawa were trying to introduce a supply-side economic policy as a cure for the stagflation that was threatening the US economy with failure.",
    "\nThe Democrats, who later in the Senate led the way to a supply-side policy, were, at this time, opposed (see Paul Craig Roberts, The Supply-Side Revolution, Harvard University Press, 1984).",

    "\nThe Democrats said that they would support the tax rate reductions if the Republicans would support offsetting cuts in the budget to support a balanced budget.",
    "\nThis was a ploy to put Republicans on the spot for taking away some groups\u2019 handouts in order \u201cto cut tax rates for the rich.\u201d\nThe supply-side policy did not require budget cuts, but in order to demonstrate the Democrats lack of sincerety, Hayakawa\u2019s aid and I had our senators introduce a series of budget cuts together with tax cuts that, on a static revenue basis (not counting tax revenue feedbacks from the incentives of the lower tax rates) kept the budget even, and the Democrats voted against them every time.",

    "\nIt grew with my time at the Wall Street Journal when I learned that some truthful things simply could not be said.",
    "\nIn the Treasury I experienced how those outside interests opposed to a president\u2019s policy marshall their forces and the media that they own to block it.",
    "\nLater as a member of a secret presidential committee, I saw how the CIA attempted to prevent President Reagan from ending the Cold War.",
    "\nToday, right now, at this moment, we are faced with a massive effort of the military/security complex, the neoconservatives, the Democratic Party, and the presstitute media to discredit the elected President of the United States and to overthrow him in order that the utterly corrupt elite that rule American can continue to hold on to power and to protect the massive budget of the military/security complex that, along with the Israel Lobby, funds the elections of those who rule us.",
    "\nTrump, like Reagan, was an exception, and it is the exceptions that accumulate the ire of the corrupt leftwing, bought off with money, and the ire of the media, concentrated into small tight ownership groups indebted to those who permitted the illegal concentration of a once independent and diverse American media that once served, on occasion, as a watchdog over government.",
    "\nThe rightwing, wrapped in the flag, dismisses all truth as \u201canti-American.\u201d\nIf Putin, Lavrov, the Russian government, the traitorous Russian Fifth Column\u2014the Atlanticist Integrationists\u2014the Chinese, the Iranians, the North Koreans think that any peace or consideration can come out of America, they are insane.",

    "\nTrump cannot even trust the Secret Service, which accumulated evidence suggests was complicit in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and Robert Kennedy.",
    "\nIf Putin and Lavrov, so anxious to be friends of Washington, let their guards down, they are history.",
    "\nAs I said above, Russiagate is an orchestratration to prevent peace between the US and Russia.",
    "\nLeading military/security complex experts, including the person who provided the CIA\u2019s daily briefing of the President of the United States for many years, and the person who devised the spy program for the National Security Agency, have proven conclusively that Russiagate is a hoax designed for the purpose of preventing President Trump from normalizing relations between the US and Russia, which has the power to destroy the entirety of the Western World at will.",
    "\nHere is the report from the retired security professionals who, unlike those still in office, cannot be fired and deprived of a careet for telling the truth.",
    "\nHere is what the clued-in Russian Defense Minister Shoigu has to say about the aggressive actions of the West against the Russian homeland.",
    "\nIf Putin doesn\u2019t listen to him, Russia is in the trash can of history.",
    "\nKeep in mind that no media informs you better than my website.",
    "\nIf my website goes down, you will be left in darkness.",
    "\nNo valid information comes from the US government or the Western presstitutes.",
    "\nIf you sit in front of the TV screen watching the Western media, you are brainwashed beyond all hope.",
    "\nNot even I can rescue you.",
    "\nNor God himself.",
    "\nAmericans, and indeed the Russians themselves, are incapable of realizing it, but there is a chance that Trump will be overthrown and a Western assault will be launched against the handful of countries that insist on sovereignty.",
    "\nI doubt that few of the Americans who elected Trump will be taken in by the anti-Trump propagana, but they are not organized and have no armed power.",
    "\nThe police, militarized by George W. Bush and Obama, will be set against them.",
    "\nThe rebellions will be local and suppressed by every violation of the US Constitution by the private powers that rule Washington, as always has been the case with rebellions in America.",
    "\nIn the West, which the Russians are so anxious to join, all freedoms are dead\u2014freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of inquiry, freedom of privacy, freedom from arbitrary search, freedom from arbitrary arrest, along with the Constitutional protections of due process and habeas corpus.",
    "\nToday there are no countries less free than the United States of America.",
    "\nWhy do the Russian Atlanticist Integrationists want to join an unfree Western world?",
    "\nAre they that brainwashed by Western Propaganda?",
    "\nIf Putin listens to these deluded fools, Putin will destroy Russia.",
    "\nThere is something wrong with Russian perception of Washington.",
    "\nApparently the Russian elite, with the exception of Shoigu and a few others are incapable of comprehending the neoconservative drive for US world hegemony and the neoconservative determination to destroy Russia as a constraint on US unilateralism.",
    "\nThe Russian government somehow, despite all evidence to the contrary, believes that Washington\u2019s hegemony is negotiable.",

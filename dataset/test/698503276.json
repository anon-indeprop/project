    "Kerry On Edge As Legacy Crumbles\n\nFormer Secretary of State John Kerry wasted no time condemning President Trump\u2019s decision not to recertify, and to possibly withdraw from, the disastrous nuclear deal with Iran that Kerry negotiated on behalf of his boss Barack Obama.",
    "\nPresident Trump insisted on significant improvements to the Joint Plan of Comprehensive Action (JCPOA), as the deal is formally known.",
    "\nThe JCPOA\u2019s fundamental flaws that President Trump wants fixed include Iran\u2019s ability to block unfettered international inspections, the wiggle room that Iran is exploiting to continue developing and testing ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons, and the sunset clause on nuclear enrichment that would provide Iran a clear path to becoming a nuclear armed state after the current restrictions are lifted.",
    "\nObama and Kerry had promised that these issues would be dealt with satisfactorily before agreeing to the final terms of the JCPOA.",
    "\nInstead they caved to Iranian pressure in order to get the deal done.",
    "\nNow that President Trump is trying to clean up the mess Obama and Kerry left him, Kerry has the gall to label President Trump\u2019s decision a \"reckless abandonment of facts in favor of ego and ideology\" and to accuse the Trump administration of \u201clying to the American people.\u201d It was the Obama administration that recklessly abandoned the facts in pressing ahead with the deal.",
    "\nThe Obama administration lied to the American people, abandoning its own promises to ensure that the deal contained ironclad protections.",
    "\nMoreover, all that President Trump has done so far is to return the JCPOA to Congress for review.",
    "\nHad Obama followed the Constitution and submitted the JCPOA to the Senate as a treaty in the first place, the JCPOA in its present form almost certainly would not have been approved.",
    "\nCongress should now have the opportunity to revisit the JCPOA to determine whether the protections that the Obama administration promised are working as advertised.",
    "\nCongress should also consider whether time limits on Iran\u2019s commitments continue to make sense in light of what we are now experiencing with Iran\u2019s nuclear technology collaborator, North Korea.",
    "\nIt bought time to turn into a full-fledged nuclear power under our noses.",
    "\nKerry had promised that the Iranian regime would be prohibited from testing ballistic missiles.",
    "\nThis turned out to be a lie.",
    "\nAfter the JCPOA was finalized, with no such prohibition included, Iran continued to test such missiles.",
    "\nThe Obama administration\u2019s response was that the missiles had become a separate issue, to be dealt with under a new United Nations Security Council resolution endorsing the JCPOA.",
    "\nThe new resolution replaced clear prohibitions imposed on Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program with a weak declaration in an annex that simply \u201ccalls upon\u201d Iran not to undertake any activity such as development and test launches related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons for eight years.",
    "\nIran has tested several ballistic missiles during the last two years, including two Qadr H missiles with the phrase \u201cIsrael must be wiped out\u201d emblazoned on the sides.",
    "\nThe commander of Iran\u2019s Army, Major General Ataollah Salehi, had told reporters just a month before the launch of those missiles that Iran was \"neither paying any attention to the resolutions against Iran, nor implementing them.",
    "\nThis is not a breach of the JCPOA.\u201d\nRussian Ambassador to the United Nations Vitaly Churkin, spurning requests from Obama administration officials to impose sanctions against Iran under the Security Council resolution, asserted that the Iranian missile test did not violate the resolution.",
    "\n\u201cA call is different from a ban so legally you cannot violate a call, you can comply with a call or you can ignore the call, but you cannot violate a call,\u201d the Russian ambassador said.",
    "\nIn short, the JCPOA did not cover the missile tests and the replacement UN Security Council resolution that did mention the missiles is toothless.",
    "\nDeputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes told CNN, during an interview aired on April 6, 2015, that under the deal\u2019s terms then still being negotiated, \u201cyou will have anywhere, anytime, 24/7 access as it relates to the nuclear facilities that Iran has.\"",
    "\nRhodes claimed that \u201cif we see a site that we need to inspect on a military facility, we can get access to that site and inspect it.",
    "\nSo if it's a suspicious site that we believe is related to its nuclear efforts, we can get access and inspect that site through the IAEA.\u201d This was another lie.",
    "\nAfter the JCPOA was finalized in July 2015, Rhodes shamelessly denied that anytime, anywhere inspections were ever considered as part of the negotiations.",
    "\n\u201cWe never sought in this negotiation the capacity for so-called anytime, anywhere,\u201d Rhodes said on July 14, 2015.",
    "\nThe JCPOA\u2019s supporters, including Kerry, have made much of the fact that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has on several occasions verified Iran\u2019s compliance with its commitments under the JCPOA, keeping its stock of low-enriched uranium below the limit set forth in the JCPOA and not pursuing further construction of the Arak reactor.",
    "\nIran was found to have slightly exceeded the limit on its stock of heavy water, but has remedied the problem to the IAEA\u2019s satisfaction.",
    "\nIAEA chief Yukiya Amano reiterated in a statement he issued on October 9th that Iran has remained in compliance with its JCPOA commitments.",
    "\nThe problem, as any clear-eyed observer of the process recognizes, is that the IAEA relies on Iran for self-inspection of certain sites that the regime does not want the IAEA to inspect freely on its own.",
    "\nIAEA inspectors have avoided examining military sites it knows exists and has no reliable way of tracking undeclared sites.",
    "\nThe IAEA\u2019s explanation for not visiting any of Iran\u2019s known military sites is that it had \u201cno reason to ask\u201d for access.",
    "\nEvidently, the IAEA is supposed to block out the fact that Iran had conducted tests relevant to nuclear bomb detonations at a military site before the JCPOA\u2019s finalization in 2015.",
    "\nThe IAEA should just pretend that such tests could not possibly happen again.",
    "\n\u201cNobody is allowed to visit Iran's military sites,\u201d said Iran\u2019s Head of Strategic Research Center at the Expediency Council and adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, Ali Akbar Velayati.",
    "\nIntimidation works.",
    "\nThe IAEA knows not to ask.",
    "\nAs to the JCPOA\u2019s sunset provisions, the Obama administration lied about that too.",
    "\nKerry claimed on September 2, 2015 that the JCPOA \u201cnever sunsets.",
    "\nThere\u2019s no sunset in this agreement.\u201d\nThis month Kerry has resorted to parsing words.",
    "\nHe claims the phrase 'sunset provisions' is a \u201cmisnomer,\u201d before then defending the JCPOA\u2019s time limits.",
    "\n\"We were comfortable because the cap on Iran\u2019s low-enriched uranium stockpile remains in place until 2030,\u201d Kerry wrote in an article published in the Washington Post late last month.",
    "\nIn other words, let\u2019s just kick the can down the road and hope for a more reasonable Iranian regime in 13 years that would agree to extend the time limits.",
    "\nIn the meantime, Kerry advises us not to worry.",
    "\nKerry declared, \u201c15 or 25 years from now, we still have the same military options we have today.\u201d\nJohn Kerry has obviously learned nothing from the North Korean fiasco, which resulted from years of phony agreements with the rogue regime and so-called \u201cstrategic patience.\u201d The United States clearly does not have the same military options today to deal with a nuclear armed North Korea as it did 23 years ago when former President Bill Clinton decided not to use military force to stamp out North Korea\u2019s nuclear program at its inception.",
    "\nInstead, Clinton started us down the primrose path of na\u00efve diplomacy with a duplicitous regime that now is on the verge of being able to strike the U.S. mainland with nuclear warheads delivered by intercontinental ballistic missiles.",
    "\nIt is precisely because North Korea\u2019s actions over the last 23 years have proven that making concessions to a rogue regime in order to obtain denuclearization commitments is so dangerous that President Trump does not want to make the same mistake with Iran.",
    "\nAmerica\u2019s European allies are also upset with President Trump for refusing to recertify the deal and threatening to pull out if certain conditions are not met.",
    "\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel issued a joint statement last Friday praising the JCPOA and its implementation.",
    "\nThey said that the nuclear deal with Iran was \u201cthe culmination of 13 years of diplomacy and was a major step towards ensuring that Iran\u2019s nuclear programme is not diverted for military purposes.",
    "\nTherefore, we encourage the US Administration and Congress to consider the implications to the security of the US and its allies before taking any steps that might undermine the JCPOA, such as re-imposing sanctions on Iran lifted under the agreement.\u201d\nPerhaps these European leaders should remember their own history.",
    "\nAppeasement through phony deals with a rogue dictatorship does not work, as proven by the infamous Munich Pact signed by British and French Prime Ministers Neville Chamberlain and Edouard Daladier with German Chancellor Adolf Hitler seventy-nine years ago."

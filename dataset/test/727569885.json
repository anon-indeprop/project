    "\n\u201cWhen the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of a corrupt dictatorship,\u201d he stated, \u201cI did not stay silent.",
    "\nAmerica stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom.\u201d\nBy contrast, Barack Obama and his obsequious acolytes were besotted by the prospect of forging d\u00e9tente with the despotic mullahs of the Islamic Republic.",

    "\nBut the deterrent effect of the Navy\u2019s 5th Fleet, and for that matter America\u2019s military might, is only as effective as the political leadership that commands it, and Barack Obama as Commander in Chief of the armed forces did little to instill fear or project deterrence.",

    "\nIn fact, Iran\u2019s attitude adjustment in the Arabian Gulf is no mystery and stems from the Trump administration\u2019s implementation of a new robust foreign policy vis-\u00e0-vis the Islamic Republic.",
    "\nSoon after taking office, Trump noted that \u201cIran [was] playing with fire\u201d and added that he wouldn\u2019t be as \u201ckind\u201d to the mullahs as Obama was.",

    "\nSanctions were also imposed against the IRGC for supporting terrorism.",
    "\nTrump\u2019s DOJ revived and breathed new life into Project Cassandra, a promising anti-Hezbollah/IRGC law enforcement initiative shelved by Obama.",

    "\nThose modifications would include an end to absurd sunset clauses in the JCPOA and tough restrictions on ballistic missile testing.",
    "\nThe mullahs have become cognizant of the fact that there\u2019s a new sheriff in town, one that backs up tough talk with action and doesn\u2019t ask \u201chow high\u201d when they say \u201cjump.\u201d Clearly, the IRGC\u2019s new docile posture in the Arabian Gulf is a direct consequence of this realization."

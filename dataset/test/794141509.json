    "\nas do all the other corporate media outlets out there, they changed their headline to \u201cFacebook purged over 800 U.S. accounts and pages for pushing political spam.\u201d\nThe fact that many of these accounts were also suspended by Twitter shortly thereafter should tell you that this is a coordinated effort to silence large swaths of the population.",

    "\nSputnik News contacted many of the alternative journalists who were purged to get their take on what happened.",

    "\nThis obviously took market share and influence away from the traditional media, and it has allowed for a more diverse public conversation.",
    "\nNow it seems the platforms that have monopolized the industry are favoring mainstream sources and silencing alternative voices.",

    "\nPeople think that we are just providing an activist spin on the news, but they don\u2019t see the families struggling to have their voice heard.",

    "\nWe give the victims and their families a voice, which is essential to keep power in check.",
    "\nThis also goes for bigger issues like foreign policy as well; multiple full-scale invasions of Syria have been prevented because of information that the alternative media made viral.",

    "\nBack in September, an assault was led by YouTube, Google, and Facebook against Alex Jones of Infowars fame.",
    "\nAll of his accounts were shut down in quick succession, followed by his credit card processing companies and his newsletter service providers.",
    "\nI wrote at the time, \u201cAlex Jones is just the beginning of this purge.",
    "\nIt\u2019s going to get much worse.\u201d\nMeanwhile, other dissenting voices were being silenced on social media with limited reach and \u201cshadow banning.\u201d\nInfowars is a massive profit machine.",
    "\nBut what happens when similar attacks are launched on smaller alternative media outlets?",
    "\nIt hits us right in the wallet.",
    "\nAnd if they\u2019re hit hard enough, they\u2019ll cease to be able to function.",
    "\nJones has a lot of money so this may not be the end of him, but for most website owners, this would be the absolute end of our ability to do business.",
    "\nAnd to be able to bring the information we bring, we do have to run our websites as businesses.",
    "\nIt\u2019s far more expensive than most people realize to run a site.",
    "\nI know that my own operating costs every month are more than $2000.",
    "\nA site as big as Jones\u2019s would be many times that amount.",
    "\nWhen all your avenues of monetization are cut off, it wouldn\u2019t be hard for a site \u2013 and the dissent and information they share \u2013 to cease to exist.",
    "\n(source)\nThis is not just about Facebook or Twitter.",
    "\nIt\u2019s about the ability to find dissenting information, period.",
    "\nGoogle is in on it too.",
    "\nA leaked document from Google supported the idea of censorship.",

    "\nThe news publication reports that an 85-page briefing entitled \u201cThe Good Censor,\u201d advises tech companies to \u201cpolice tone instead of content\u201d and to not \u201ctake sides\u201d when censoring users\u2026 Google might continue to shift with the times \u2013 changing its stance on how much or how little it censors (due to public, governmental or commercial pressures).",
    "\nIf it does, acknowledgment of what this shift in position means for users and for Google is essential.",
    "\nShifting blindly or silently in one direction or another rightly incites users\u2019 fury\u2026 The Google \u201cinternal research\u201d even quotes outside experts like George Soros who express justification of censorship in non-U.S. markets, noting that Google should police \u201ctone instead of content\u201d and \u201ccensor everyone equally,\u201d as Breitbart put it.",
    "\n(source)\nThere are 2 trillion Google searches per day.",
    "\nPER.",
    "\nDAY.",
    "\nThat should give you an idea of the power of something like Google.",
    "\nCombine it with billions of Facebook and Twitter users and you can easily see the influence wielded here.",
    "\nThis is where free thought goes to die.",
    "\nRon Paul reminds us that truth is treason.",
    "\nRon Paul, former senator and the libertarian voice of reason, said when Jones was purged:\n\u201cYou get accused of treasonous activity and treasonous speech because in an empire of lies the truth is treason,\u201d Paul told the Russia-based news outlet.",
    "\n\u201cChallenging the status quo is what they can\u2019t stand and it unnerves them, so they have to silence people.\u201d \u201cSome of us tell the truth about our government, they call us treasonous and say we\u2019re speaking out of line and they\u2019d like to punish us, and I think that\u2019s part of what\u2019s happening with social media,\u201d Paul told RT, adding that he hopes anti-government or anti-war voices can eliminate their \u201cdependency\u201d on the current social media platforms.",
    "\n\u201cI\u2019m just hoping that technology can stay ahead of it all and that we can have real alternatives to the dependency on Twitter and other companies that have been working hand in glove with the government,\u201d Paul added.",
    "\n(source)\nHere\u2019s a video from last month with Dr. Paul\u2019s thoughts about the social media purge.",
    "\nIn it, he reminds us that Facebook is a private entity so they do have every right to remove the pages they wish.",
    "\nThe danger \u2013 and the area in which this treads on the First Amendment \u2013 is their direct ties to the government.",
    "\nThis affects everyone.",
    "\nIf you\u2019re reading this and you shrug because you, personally, don\u2019t have a Twitter or Facebook account, you\u2019re missing the bigger point.",
    "\nConsider the fact that the \u201cpopulation\u201d of Facebook is bigger than the populations of the US, China, and Brazil combined.",
    "\nThat\u2019s how many people will now only receive one side of the story on things like war, politics, guns, and current events.",
    "\nPeople will believe what they\u2019re told because there is no alternative information presented.",
    "\nThere are no questions asked.",
    "\nIt\u2019s literally the textbook definition of brainwashing.",
    "\nDefinition of brainwashing\n1: a forcible indoctrination to induce someone to give up basic political, social, or religious beliefs and attitudes and to accept contrasting regimented ideas 2: persuasion by propaganda or salesmanship (source)\n(Here\u2019s an article from Psychology Today that discusses how Facebook is, in fact, brainwashing people for profit.)",
    "\nSocial media is a massive source of information and influence today.",
    "\nIf the information is rigged by entities that support socialism, gun control, and the end of privacy, we\u2019re doomed.",
    "\n2.2 billion active users will be bombarded with these messages without any real option for the other side of the story.",
    "\nSo regardless of whether you, personally, participate, this will color popular sentiment to a massive degree.",
    "\nIt will grow the cognitive dissonance that assures people of things like \u201cthe government is your friend\u201d and that \u201cyou don\u2019t need to protect yourself, the police will take care of you.\u201d\nPeople who hate freedom will get unfettered access to the minds of 2 billion people.",
    "\nThat should scare the crap out of you.",
    "\nWhat can you do about the alternative media purge?",
    "\nIt\u2019s possible but unlikely that social pressure on Facebook and Twitter will push the outlets into restoring the accounts of these alternative media networks.",
    "\nBut even if they are restored, I suspect their reach will dwindle even further.",
    "\nHere are a few things you can do:\nSubscribe to the newsletters of websites you enjoy.",
    "\nDon\u2019t count on seeing their work on social media.",
    "\n(You can subscribe to my newsletter here, incidentally.)",
    "\nSupport them financially if you can.",

    "Madagascar Outbreak: It Is \u2018Inevitable\u2019 The Plague Becomes Resistant To Drugs\n\nThe newest warning about the outbreak of the airborne pneumonic plague, or black death, in Madagascar has been released.",
    "\nOfficials warn that it\u2019s inevitable that this bacterial infection that\u2019s infected over 2000 people will become resistant to antibiotics.",
    "\nThe only way to treat a person who has contracted the plague is with antibiotics.",
    "\nBut experts now warn that because they are being used so much to treat the infection, antibiotics resistance is inevitable and making this disease much more terrifying.",
    "\nOnce the bacteria is resistant, the Madagascar healthcare system will be overwhelmed, and the disease will have control of the nation.",
    "\nAccording to the Daily Mail, Madagascar\u2019s healthcare system will be unable to cope if the deadly plague outbreak continues to escalate, a scientist has warned.",
    "\nScores of doctors and nurses have been struck down with the disease, which is predicted to gather momentum in the coming weeks and there are growing fears hospitals will be unable to meet the illness\u2019 burden.",
    "\nOfficial figures reveal at least 2,034 people have been infected with the \u201cmedieval disease\u201d so far in what has been described as the \u201cworst outbreak in 50 years.\u201d The black death outbreak has so far claimed at least 165 lives.",
    "\nAlthough the plague is responding well to antibiotics right now, drug resistance is also an increasing concern amongst experts who predict it will vastly accelerate the disease\u2019s death toll.",
    "\nProfessor John Joe McFadden from the University of Surrey told MailOnline: \u201cFortunately in [the] plague, it has not developed much antibiotic resistance.",
    "\nIf that kicks in, the plague will be far, far scarier.",
    "\nIf you throw more and more antibiotics at patients, antibiotic resistance is more or less inevitable.\u201d\nDr. Derek Gatherer, from Lancaster University\u2019s biomedical and life-sciences department, told MailOnline the country would struggle \u201cto cope\u201d if cases continue to spiral.",
    "\n\u201cMadagascar, typically like many African countries, doesn\u2019t have many doctors.",
    "\nThere are around three-and-a-half thousand doctors for 22 million people.",
    "\nThey only have around 6,000 hospital beds, so they aren\u2019t particularly well positioned to cope with these kind of events.",
    "\nAnd if it wasn\u2019t for the international aid coming in things would definitely be much worse for them.\u201d\nAnd experts continue to fear the healthcare system is on the brink of being overwhelmed.",
    "\nShould the disease actually spread to the African mainland, it will be all but impossible to control and the health care system would certainly be unable to handle the outbreak at that point, making a global pandemic much more likely."

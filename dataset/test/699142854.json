    "THE OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS OF TRUMP'S IRAN INITIATIVE\n\nOriginally published the Jerusalem Post.",
    "\nOn Friday, US President Donald Trump initiated an important change in US policy toward Iran.",
    "\n\nNo, in his speech decertifying Iran\u2019s compliance with the nuclear accord it struck with his predecessor Barack Obama, Trump didn\u2019t announce a new strategy for preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, or stemming its hegemonic rise in the Middle East, or limiting its ability to sponsor terrorism.",
    "\nTrump\u2019s move was not operational.",
    "\nIt was directional.",
    "\n\nIn his address Friday, Trump changed the policy dynamics that dictate US policy on Iran.",
    "\nFor the first time since 2009, when Obama backed the murderous regime in Tehran, spurning the millions of Iranians who rose up in the Green Revolution, Trump opened up the possibility that the US may begin to base its policies toward Iran on reality.",
    "\n\nTrump began his remarks by setting out Iran\u2019s long rap sheet of aggression against America.",
    "\n\nStarting with the US embassy seizure and hostage crisis, Trump described Iran\u2019s crimes and acts of war against America in greater detail than any of his predecessors ever did.",
    "\n\nTrump\u2019s dossier was interlaced with condemnations of the regime\u2019s repression of its own people.",
    "\n\nBy merging Iran\u2019s external aggression with its internal repression, Trump signaled a readiness to drive a wedge \u2013 or expand the wedge \u2013 between the authoritarian theocrats that rule Iran and the largely secular, multiethnic and pro-Western people of Iran.",
    "\n\nTrump then turned his attention to Iran\u2019s illicit ballistic missile program, its sponsorship of terrorism, including its links to al-Qaida, its aggression against its neighbors, its aggressive acts against maritime traffic in the Straits of Hormuz, and its bids to destabilize and control large swaths of the Middle East through its proxies.",
    "\n\nIt is notable that these remarks preceded Trump\u2019s discussion of the nuclear deal \u2013 which was the ostensible subject of his speech.",
    "\nBefore Trump discussed Iran\u2019s breaches of the nuclear deal, he first demonstrated that contrary to the expressed views of his top advisers, it is impossible to limit a realistic discussion of the threat Iran constitutes to US national security and interests to whether or not and it what manner it is breaching the nuclear accord.",
    "\n\nThis was a critical point because for the past two years, US discourse on Iran has focused solely on whether or not Iran was complying with Obama\u2019s nuclear pact.",
    "\nBy placing the nuclear deal in the context of Iran\u2019s consistent, overarching hostility and aggression, Trump made it self-evident that no US interest is served in continuing to give Iran a free pass from congressional sanctions.",
    "\n\nAfter accomplishing that goal, Trump turned his attention to how Iran is actually breaching the letter and spirit of the nuclear pact.",
    "\nOnly then, almost as an afterthought, did he announce that he was decertifying Iranian compliance with the nuclear deal, setting the conditions for the renewal of congressional sanctions on Iran and opening the floodgates of congressional sanctions on Iran in retaliation for the full spectrum of its aggressive and illicit acts against the US, its interests and allies.",
    "\n\nBy empowering Congress to prohibit economic cooperation with Iran, Trump put the Europeans, Chinese and Russians on notice that they may soon face a choice between conducting business with the US and conducting business with Iran.",
    "\n\nAfter putting them on notice, Trump discussed the possibility of improving Obama\u2019s nuclear accord.",
    "\nAmong other things, he suggested expanding the inspection regime against Iran\u2019s nuclear installations and canceling the so-called \u201csunset\u201d clause that places an end date on the restrictions governing certain components of Iran\u2019s nuclear advancement.",
    "\n\nTrump\u2019s address has the potential to serve as the foundation of a major, positive shift in US policy toward Iran.",
    "\nSuch a shift could potentially facilitate the achievement of Trump\u2019s goals of preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, containing its regional aggression and empowerment and defeating its terrorist proxies.",
    "\n\nUnfortunately, it is also likely, indeed, it is more likely, that his words will not be translated into policies to achieve these critical aims.",
    "\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to transfer immediate responsibility to Congress for holding Iran accountable for its hostile actions on the military and other fronts is a risky move.",
    "\nHe has a lot of enemies, and the nuclear deal has a lot of supporters on Capitol Hill.",
    "\n\nObama would have never been able to implement his nuclear deal if Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, hadn\u2019t agreed to cast the Constitution aside and ignore Obama\u2019s constitutional duty to present the nuclear deal to the Senate for ratification as a treaty.",
    "\n\nOver the past week, Trump and Corker have been involved in an ugly public fight precipitated by Corker\u2019s announcement that he will not be seeking reelection next year.",
    "\n\nToday Corker has nothing to restrain him from scuttling Trump\u2019s agenda.",
    "\nIf he wishes, out of spite, Corker can block effective sanctions from being passed.",
    "\nAnd he may do so even though the implications for his Senate colleagues would be dire and even though doing so would render him an unofficial protector of Iran\u2019s nuclear program.",
    "\n\nWhat is true for Corker is doubly true for the Democrats.",
    "\n\nLeading Democratic senators like Robert Menendez, Ben Cardin and Chuck Schumer, who opposed Obama\u2019s Iran deal may now feel that as opponents of the Trump administration, they are required to oppose any change to the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act.",
    "\n\nIndeed, given the rise of radical forces in their party it is likely that they would rather give Iran a free pass for its anti-American aggression and nuclear proliferation than work with Republicans on Capitol Hill and in the White House.",
    "\n\nThen again, by framing the issue of Iran\u2019s threat to America as he did, and by transferring responsibility for reinstating sanctions and passing further sanctions on Iran to Congress, Trump opened up the possibility that Congress will conduct substantive \u2013 rather than personal \u2013 debates on Iran.",
    "\n\nAnd the more substantive those debates become, the further away the US discourse will move from the mendacious assumptions of Obama\u2019s Iran policy \u2013 that the Iranian regime is a responsible actor and potential US ally, and that there is nothing inherently aggressive or problematic about Iran\u2019s illicit nuclear weapons program.",
    "\n\nThe second major risk inherent in Trump\u2019s approach is that he will get his way; that the Europeans, Russians and Chinese and the Iranians will agree to improve the nuclear deal.",
    "\nThe problem here is not obvious.",
    "\nClearly, it is better if the deal is amended to delete the sunset clauses and expand the inspections regime.",
    "\n\nYet even an amended, improved deal will still serve as a shield to Iran\u2019s nuclear program.",
    "\nAn improved deal won\u2019t destroy Iran\u2019s centrifuges.",
    "\n\nIt won\u2019t take away Iran\u2019s enriched uranium.",
    "\nIt won\u2019t destroy Iran\u2019s nuclear installations.",
    "\nAnd it won\u2019t bring down the regime which by its nature ensures all of these things will remain a menace to the US, its allies and international security as a whole.",
    "\n\nSo long as the US continues to maintain a policy based on the false view that all that is necessary to destroy the threat of a nuclear armed Iran is a combination of the nuclear deal and economic sanctions, it will continue to ensure that Iran and its nuclear program remain a major threat.",
    "\nDistressingly, US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, the most outspoken supporter of decertifying Iranian compliance in the Trump administration, told NBC on Sunday that the US intends to remain in the nuclear deal.",
    "\n\nTo understand what must be done we must return to Trump\u2019s speech and its strategic significance.",
    "\n\nBy taking a holistic view of the Iranian threat \u2013 grounded in a recognition of the inherent hostility of the regime \u2013 Trump opened up the possibility that the US and its allies can develop a holistic policy for confronting and defeating Iran and its proxies.",
    "\nIf the Iran deal and sanctions are two components to a larger strategy rather than the entire strategy, they can be helpful.",
    "\n\nA wider strategy would target Iran\u2019s regional aggression by weakening its proxies and clients from Hezbollah and Hamas to the regimes in Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Lebanon.",
    "\nIt would target the regime itself by empowering the ayatollahs\u2019 domestic opponents.",
    "\nIt would pin down Iranian forces by arming and otherwise assisting the Iraqi Kurds to defend and maintain their control over their territory along the Iranian border while strengthening the ties between Iranian Kurds and Iraqi Kurds.",
    "\n\nFriday, Trump created the possibility for such a strategy.",
    "\nIt is up to members of Congress, and US allies like Israel and the Sunni Arab states to help Trump conceive and implement it.",
    "\nIf they fail, the possibility Trump created will be lost, perhaps irrevocably."

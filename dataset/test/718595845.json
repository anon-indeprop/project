    "The US Is Blatantly Telling Lies\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that the Trump administration has a strong distaste for Iran.",
    "\nIran is one of the only issues on which the U.S. president has remained relatively consistent.",
    "\nTrump berated the country both before and after taking office.",
    "\nHowever, Trump\u2019s anti-Iran strategy goes against the better judgment of even the most anti-Iranian advisors in his staff who don\u2019t want to see the U.S. isolated on the world stage.",
    "\nFortunately for Trump, however, he is not alone in his bid to isolate and demonize Iran at all costs.",
    "\nOn December 12, Trump\u2019s ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley, gave a grandiose speech demonizing Iran that echoed Colin Powell\u2019s infamous performance before the U.N. in 2003.",
    "\nHaley\u2019s essential claim was that Saudi Arabia is under attack by missiles supplied to Yemen by the Iranian government and that the world should not sit idly by as this goes on.",
    "\n\u201cIf we do nothing about the missiles fired at Saudi Arabia, we will not be able to stop the violence,\u201d Haley warned.",
    "\n\u201cThere is clear evidence that the missiles that landed on Saudi Arabia come from Iran,\u201d she said.",
    "\n\u201cThe evidence is undeniable.",
    "\nThe weapons might as well have had \u2018Made in Iran\u2019 stickers all over it.\u201d\nBuy Gold at Discounted Prices\nHowever, even as Haley opened her mouth, many commentators could already identify a number of issues with her speech.",
    "\nAs Common Dream\u2019s Reza Marashi explained:\n\u201cHaley cited a UN report in her claim regarding Iranian missile transfers to the Houthis.",
    "\nOf course, the UN has reached no such conclusion.",
    "\nInstead, a panel of experts concluded that fired missile fragments show components from an Iranian company, but they have \u2018no evidence as to the identity of the broker or supplier.\u2019 Asked about Haley\u2019s claim that Iran is the culprit, Sweden\u2019s ambassador to the UN said, \u2018The info I have is less clear.\u2019 Analysts from the U.S. Department of Defense speaking to reporters at Haley\u2019s speech openly acknowledged that they do not know the missiles\u2019 origin.",
    "\nPerhaps most surreal is the very same UN report cited by Haley also says the missile included a component that was manufactured by an American company.",
    "\nDid she disingenuously omit that inconvenient bit from her remarks, or fail to read the entire UN report?",
    "\nThe world may never know.\u201d\nRegardless of the fact that Haley misrepresented the U.N. report in question, it appears the entire premise of the U.N. report is almost completely incorrect, anyway, according to former inspector Scott Ritter.",
    "\nRitter writes:\n\u201cThe missile debris in question actually contradicts the finding of the UN panel, which held that the missiles launched against Saudi Arabia had been transferred to Yemen in pieces and assembled there by Houthi missile engineers; it is clear that the missiles in question had been in the possession of Yemen well before the Saudi Arabian-led intervention of 2015, and that their source was either Soviet or North Korean.",
    "\nThe modification kits, on the other hand, appear to be of Iranian origin, and were transported to Yemen via Oman.",
    "\nThe UN panel claims not to have any evidence of \u2018external missile specialists\u2019 working alongside the Houthi; indeed, the simplicity of the Burkhan 2-H modification concept is such that anyone already familiar with the SCUD-B missile system would be able to implement the required processes without outside assistance.\u201d [emphasis added]\nSo where did the missiles come from, and who made them?",
    "\nAccording to Ritter:\n\u201cRather than the Iranian-manufactured Qiam-1 missiles Haley and the Saudi Arabian government claimed, the debris presented by Haley were of a modified Soviet-manufactured SCUD-B missile; the airframe and engine are original Soviet-made components, and many of the smaller parts on display bear Cyrillic (i.e., Russian) markings.",
    "\nThe transformation to the Burkhan 2-H design required the Houthi engineers to increase the size of the fuel and oxidizer tanks, and lengthen the airframe accordingly.",
    "\nThis is done by cutting the airframe, and welding in place the appropriate segments (this also required that the fuel supply pipe, which passes through the oxidizer tank, be similarly lengthened.)",
    "\nThe difference in quality between the factory welds and the new welds is readily discernable.",
    "\nThe increased fuel supply permits a longer engine burn, which in turn increases the range of the missile.",
    "\nThe Burkhan 2-H uses a smaller warhead than the SCUD B; as such, the guidance and control section had been reconfigured to a smaller diameter, and an inter-stage section added to connect the warhead/guidance section with the main airframe.\u201d\n\ufeff\nThose who have been paying attention to this conflict have been well aware that the U.S. has had little material evidence to link Yemen\u2019s Houthis to Iranian arms suppliers.",
    "\nIn January of this year, a panel of U.N. experts stated:\n\u201cThe panel has not seen sufficient evidence to confirm any direct large-scale supply of arms from the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, although there are indicators that anti-tank guided weapons being supplied to the Houthi or Saleh forces are of Iranian manufacture.\u201d [emphasis added]\nEven if Iran were arming the Houthis, Haley\u2019s hypocritical anti-Iran rhetoric doesn\u2019t excuse the U.S. for continuing a foreign policy that essentially armed ISIS through U.S. weapons transfers, or for arming al-Qaeda\u2019s affiliate in Syria, just to name two examples of Washington\u2019s schizophrenic approach to the region.",
    "\nWhy is the U.S. singling out Iran, especially when the Houthi rebels are sworn enemies of al-Qaeda?",
    "\nThe issues here go much deeper than nonsensical hypocrisy.",
    "\nAccording to Ritter, the entire debacle has shown that if Saudi Arabia cannot contain the Houthi\u2019s missile capabilities, it cannot possibly hope to take on Iran, which possesses a significantly more advanced military than the Houthis do on their own.",
    "\nRitter explains further:\n\u201cIf a relatively unsophisticated foe such as the Houthi, using Iranian-modified Soviet and North Korean missiles derived from 40-year-old technology, can evade an enemy force using the most modern combat aircraft backed up by the most sophisticated intelligence gathering systems available, and successfully launch ballistic missiles that threaten the political and economic infrastructure of the targeted state, what does that say about the prospects of any U.S.-led coalition taking on the far more advanced mobile missile threats that exist in North Korea and Iran today?",
    "\nThe fact of the matter is that no military anywhere has shown the ability to successfully interdict in any meaningful way a determined opponent armed with mobile ballistic missile capability.",
    "\nIf the Saudi experience in Yemen is to teach us anything, it is that any military plan designed to confront nations such as North Korea, Iran and Russia that are armed with sophisticated mobile ballistic missiles had better count on those capabilities remaining intact throughout any anticipated period of hostility.",
    "\nNo amount of chest-thumping and empty rhetoric by American political and/or military leaders can offset this harsh reality.",
    "\nThis is the critical lesson of Yemen, and the United States would do well to heed it before it tries to foment a crisis based upon trumped-up charges.\u201d [emphasis added]"

    "Iranian Aggression Intensifies\n\nLast July, Major General Mohammad Bagheri, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) military commander and chief of staff of Iran\u2019s armed forces, warned that \u201cputting the Revolutionary Guard in the terrorist lists with terrorist groups can be very costly to the United States and its military bases and forces in the region.\u201d IRGC commander Mohammad Ali Jafari said on October 8th that \"if the news is correct about the stupidity of the American government in considering the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist group, then the Revolutionary Guards will consider the American army to be like Islamic State all around the world.\"",
    "\nThe next day the Iranian regime warned of a \"crushing\" response if the United States were to designate the IRGC as a terrorist organization.",
    "\nPresident Trump has called the Iranian regime\u2019s bluff with his announcement last week that he would do just that.",
    "\nDesignating the IRGC as a terrorist organization and imposing new sanctions for its aggressive actions in the region is not a restoration of the sanctions lifted by the Obama administration as part of its disastrous nuclear deal with Iran.",
    "\nIf Iran insists it can do what it wants militarily in terms of missile launches, support of terrorist groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas, and arms transfers without violating the nuclear deal, then the United States can certainly act to curb such activities through financial pressure.",

    "\nThe Iranian regime does not see it that way, however.",
    "\nWith the lifting of the nuclear-related sanctions making available billions of dollars to Iran\u2019s leaders to further finance the IRGC\u2019s exploits in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and elsewhere, the regime is furious that the Trump administration is tightening the financial screws again, even if for reasons not directly related to Iran\u2019s compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal.",
    "\nThus, it is threatening U.S. forces and bases in the region.",
    "\nA couple of seemingly unrelated events this past week point to Iran\u2019s positioning itself for more aggressive military actions that could place U.S. forces in harm\u2019s way.",
    "\nOn Tuesday, Major General Bagheri landed in Damascus for talks with Syrian President Bashar Assad and senior Syrian officials, including the defense minister and the chief of staff of the Syrian armed forces.",
    "\nBagheri is quoted as saying that his visit\u2019s purpose was to \u201cput a joint strategy on continuing co-ordination and co-operation at the military level.\u201d Some experts on Iran believe that Bagheri\u2019s visit to Damascus at this time is intended to reinforce a message that Iran will continue to supply weaponry to Syria and to reinforce the presence of its terrorist proxy Hezbollah in Syria.",
    "\nThis will not only serve to bolster the Assad regime, but it also will strengthen Iran's ability to follow through on its threats to the U.S. and its allies, principally Israel.",
    "\nMeanwhile, following the departure of the Kurds from Kirkuk, Iraq earlier this week, the IRGC\u2019s operational Al Qods arm reportedly established a command center and five bases there.",

    "\nThe session was supposed to be devoted to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but Ambassador Haley departed from the monthly ritual during which Israel is normally singled out for criticism by other Council members.",
    "\nShe went after Iran instead.",
    "\nShe explained why the Trump administration decided to take \u201ca comprehensive approach to confronting the Iranian regime,\u201d which does not give the regime a get out of jail free card even if it is in technical compliance with the loophole-ridden nuclear deal agreed to by the Obama administration.",
    "\n\u201cWe can\u2019t talk about stability in the Middle East without talking about Iran,\u201d Ambassador Haley said.",
    "\n\u201cThat\u2019s because nearly every threat to peace and security in the Middle East is connected to Iran\u2019s outlaw behavior.",
    "\nThe United States has now embarked on a course that attempts to address all aspects of Iran\u2019s destructive conduct, not just one aspect.",
    "\nIt\u2019s critical that the international community do the same.",
    "\nJudging Iran by the narrow confines of the nuclear deal misses the true nature of the threat.",
    "\nIran must be judged in totality of its aggressive, destabilizing, and unlawful behavior.",
    "\nTo do otherwise would be foolish.\u201d\nAmbassador Haley accused the Iranian regime of continuing to \u201cplay\u201d the Security Council.",
    "\n\u201cIran hides behind its assertion of technical compliance with the nuclear deal while it brazenly violates the other limits on its behavior.",
    "\nAnd we have allowed them to get away with it.",
    "\nThis must stop.\u201d\nAmbassador Haley proceeded to list various violations by the Iranian regime of Security Council resolutions pertaining to the transfer of conventional weapons from Iran and the arming of terrorist groups, including the Houthi rebels in Yemen and Hezbollah.",

    "\n\u201cWhen a rogue regime starts down the path of ballistic missiles, it tells us that we will soon have another North Korea on our hands,\u201d Ambassador Haley said.",
    "\n\u201cIf it is wrong for North Korea to do this, why doesn\u2019t that same mentality apply to Iran?",
    "\n\u201c\nAs for the Iran\u2019s supposed technical compliance with its commitments under the nuclear deal itself, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the UN\u2019s international inspectors are not able to visit Iran\u2019s military sites.",
    "\nPast work on nuclear explosive trigger devices appears to have taken place at one or more such sites in the past.",
    "\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Yukiya Amano admitted last month that when it comes to the IAEA\u2019s capacity to check whether Iran was conducting work on a nuclear explosive device, his agency\u2019s \u201ctools are limited.\u201d The Iranian regime has also attempted to skirt the restrictions in the JCPOA on its procurement of materials, equipment, goods and technology related to Iran\u2019s nuclear activities.",
    "\nThe Heritage Foundation noted in its recent report on the JCPOA, for example, that Iran was \u201ccaught red-handed trying to purchase nuclear technology and restricted ballistic missile technology from German companies.\u201d\nU.S. intelligence had discovered North Korea\u2019s transfer of missile parts to Iran at the very same time that Iran was negotiating the nuclear deal, in clear violation of UN Security Council resolutions then in effect.",
    "\nThe Obama administration chose to look the other way.",
    "\nDoes anybody with a modicum of sense really believe that such collaboration between the two rogue nations is not going on today?",
    "\nIran is flush with cash, thanks to the JCPOA.",
    "\nIt wants to build out its missile and nuclear enrichment capabilities.",
    "\nIn addition to covert transfers of materials and technology to Iran in violation of the nuclear deal, the JCPOA may provide a loophole for Iran to exploit in outsourcing some of the development work to North Korea for hard currency, which North Korea desperately needs.",
    "\nThey are a perfect match for each other.",
    "\nProponents of the JCPOA argue that exiting the nuclear deal unless it is changed to the Trump administration\u2019s satisfaction would undermine U.S. credibility with North Korea and thereby kill any chance of negotiations to resolve the crisis caused by North Korea's continued testing of sophisticated nuclear arms and ballistic missiles.",
    "\n\"If we want to talk to North Korea now, the possible end for the nuclear deal with Iran would jeopardize the credibility of such treaties,\" Reuters quoted German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel as saying.",
    "\nGermany is one of the parties to the JCPOA.",
    "\nOther European allies have voiced similar concerns.",
    "\nSo have Obama\u2019s former Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry.",
    "\nThis argument is absurd on its face.",
    "\nThe whole point is to prevent Iran from becoming the next North Korea, not to kick the can down the road as usual.",
    "\nNorth Korea\u2019s aggressive pursuit of nuclear weapons and of intercontinental ballistic missiles equipped with nuclear warheads proves that weak agreements full of front-loaded goodies rewarding rogue regimes for elusive promises are worthless."

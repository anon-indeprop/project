    "\n\u201cThe qualifier \u2018violent\u2019 is therefore employed here to describe VOX-Pol\u2019s interest, which is in those that employ or advocate physical violence against other individuals and groups to forward their political objectives.",
    "\nThe extremist nature of the politics in which VOX-Pol is interested is thus not decided upon by project participants, but by the decision of those involved in particular types of politics to advocate or employ violence to advance their goals.\u201d\ntake our poll - story continues below\nWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?",

    "\nFor if Dr. Ganesh is in charge, we have some very worrying questions to ask.",
    "\nOne could start from the observation that the article is certainly not an academic piece, and gives no concrete evidence for any of the sweeping claims it makes about the so-called \u201calt-right\u201d and the \u201cmanosphere\u201d; nor does it, as any academic should do, attempt to test ideas and consider alternative explanations.",

    "\nThis was a heinous crime, and should rightly be condemned.",

    "\nThe BBC broadcast was the drama based on real life, Three Girls, which showed real-life events of three of the (very many) victims of the Rochdale Muslim rape gangs.",
    "\nGanesh somehow knows precisely what went on in Osborne\u2019s mind.",
    "\nRather than thinking that it was outrage at the behavior of the gangs of Muslim men of Pakistani background who abused the girls portrayed in Three Girls that caused Osborne to lose his mind and commit his terrible crime, Ganesh blames Obsorne\u2019s act on the likes of Tommy Robinson.",
    "\nYet Robinson explicitly fights AGAINST political violence.",
    "\nWhat \u201cnarrative from British counter-jihad groups\u201d can one find which suggests driving vehicles into innocent Muslims standing outside a mosque?",

    "\nI suppose if you\u2019re paid to fight online extremism, you\u2019d better find it, or you\u2019re out of a job and short of academic publication.",
    "\nWe have also the ridiculous idea that Tommy Robinson is \u201calt-right.\u201d He, in fact, describes himself as a centrist \u2013 he\u2019s said he agrees with Labour on some things, the Tories on other things, and he left the EDL precisely because he didn\u2019t like the infiltration by the far right.",
    "\nHe shows no hint of racism or of white supremacism.",
    "\nThe writer of this shoddy article is working at one of the most elite universities in the world, on research funded by the European Union, and giving advice based on this sloppy thinking to those who are in charge of manipulating and policing the communications and information we have online.",
    "\nWe have to ask.",
    "\nIs it simply a coincidence that Tommy Robinson is now in prison, and that a \u201cresearcher\u201d who presents such a misleading account of Robinson is currently actively engaged in consultation with Oxford University and the European Union in advising how to disrupt Robinson\u2019s activities, reinforcing the lies and misrepresentations about him to those in power?",
    "\nThere\u2019s more.",
    "\nBharath Ganesh\u2019s profile tells us this: \u201cDuring his Ph.D., Bharath was also a Senior Researcher at Tell MAMA, a national project dedicated to mapping and monitoring anti-Muslim hate in the United Kingdom.",

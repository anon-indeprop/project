    "\n\nGuyger allegedly walked into the apartment of the neighbor, Botham Jean, and fatally shot him Sept 6.",

    "\nThe victim\u2019s family has disputed her account and said she had knocked on Jean\u2019s door before killing him.",
    "\n\nThe incident \u2014 one of more than 700 police killings counted by The Washington Post this year \u2014 sparked criticism against the police department, which waited days to arrest Guyger, then went weeks without disciplining her even though she was placed on leave.",
    "\n\u201cThe delay raised questions about why investigators held off on arresting the officer and about whether law enforcement authorities were showing deferential treatment for one of their own,\u201d Kristine Phillips and Deanna Paul wrote for The Post.",
    "\n\nAfter repeated protests, Police Chief U. Rene\u00e9 Hall gave contradictory explanations last week for why she could not fire the officer.",
    "\nShe told a town hall that \u201clocal, state and federal laws prohibit me from taking action,\u201d according to ABC affiliate WFAA.",
    "\n\nTwo days later, the Dallas Morning News reported that police could fire Guyger but did not plan to review her employment until a criminal investigation wrapped up \u2014 probably months away.",
    "\nIn a statement, Hall said that any disciplinary investigation would risk compromising the criminal case.",
    "\n\u201cThat is not a risk I am willing to take,\u201d she said.",
    "\n\nPolice did not explain what changed by Monday, when the department announced that an internal-affairs investigation had been launched and already \u201cconcluded\u201d that Guyger\u2019s arrest was a fireable offense.",
    "\nThe officer, who was hired in late 2013, was terminated during a hearing Monday morning \u201cfor her actions.\u201d\n\nThe statement notes that Guyger can appeal her firing.",
    "\nPolice did not comment on whether Hall is still worried that the termination might affect the criminal investigation.",
    "\n\nAs Paul wrote for The Post, the more significant legal questions are whether Guyger is prosecuted as a police officer or civilian and whether a jury decides she acted reasonably in using deadly force."

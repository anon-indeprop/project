    "\nEllison first sought office as a Democrat in 1998 as Keith Ellison-Muhammad, a self-avowed member of the Nation of Islam.",
    "\n(Ellison-Muhammad is just one of three Nation of Islam names Ellison has used over the years.)",
    "\nFortunately for him, Ellison\u2019s 5th District constituents haven\u2019t much cared about his history and the Minneapolis Star Tribune has almost entirely let it rest exactly where Ellison wants it.",
    "\nBut seeking the top law enforcement job in Minnesota and running for statewide office should be a more daunting challenge because Ellison is an extraordinarily poor fit for the job.",
    "\nAmong the troubling threads that run through Ellison\u2019s career: support for cop killers.",
    "\nIn September 1992 Minneapolis police officer Jerry Haaf was murdered execution-style, shot in the back as he took a coffee break at a restaurant in south Minneapolis.",
    "\nPolice later determined that Haaf\u2019s murder was a gang hit performed by four members of the city\u2019s Vice Lords gang.The leader of the Vice Lords was Sharif Willis, a convicted murderer who had been released from prison and who sought respectability as a responsible gang leader from gullible municipal authorities while operating a gang front called United for Peace.",
    "\nThe four Vice Lords members who murdered Haaf met and planned the murder at Willis\u2019s house.",
    "\nDespite the fact that two witnesses implicated Willis in the planning he was never charged because law enforcement authorities said they lacked sufficient evidence to convict him.",
    "\nAt the time, Ellison was a Minneapolis attorney in private practice.",
    "\nAnd within a month of Haaf\u2019s murder, Ellison appeared with Willis supporting the United for Peace gang front.",
    "\nIn October 1992, Ellison helped organize a demonstration against Minneapolis police that included United for Peace.",
    "\n\u201cThe main point of our rally is to support United for Peace [in its fight against] the campaign of slander the police federation has been waging,\u201d said Ellison.",
    "\nWillis was the last speaker at the demonstration.",
    "\nAccording to a contemporaneous report in the St. Paul Pioneer Press, Willis told the crowd that Minneapolis police were experiencing the same fear from young black men that blacks had felt from police for many years.",
    "\n\u201cIf the police have some fear, I understand that fear,\u201d Willis said.",
    "\n\u201cWe seem to have an overabundance of bad police.",
    "\n.",
    "\n.",
    "\n.",
    "\n[W]e\u2019re going to get rid of them,\u201d Willis said.",
    "\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got to go.\u201d The Pioneer Press account concludes with Ellison\u2019s contribution to the demonstration: \u201cEllison told the crowd that the police union is systematically frightening whites in order to get more police officers hired.",
    "\nThat way, Ellison said, the union can increase its power base.\u201d Ellison publicly supported the Haaf murder defendants.",
    "\nIn February 1993, he spoke at a demonstration for one of them during his trial.",
    "\nEllison led the crowd assembled at the courthouse in a chant that was ominous in the context of Haaf\u2019s cold-blooded murder: \u201cWe don\u2019t get no justice, you don\u2019t get no peace.\u201d Ellison\u2019s working relationship with Sharif Willis finally came to an end in February 1995, when Willis was convicted in federal court on several counts of drug and gun-related crimes and sent back to prison for 20 years.",
    "\nThe Haaf case wasn\u2019t an aberration for Ellison.",
    "\nIn February 2000, he spoke at a fundraiser sponsored by the Minnesota chapter of the old National Lawyers Guild, on whose steering committee he had served\u2014the chapter was raising funds for former Symbionese Liberation Army member Kathleen Soliah, who had been a fugitive from justice for 25 years, on charges related to the attempted pipe bombing of Los Angeles police officers in 1975.",
    "\n(The National Lawyers Guild is an old Communist front group that somehow survived the fall of the Soviet Union.",
    "\nRegimes come and go; dupes are forever.)",
    "\nIn his National Lawyers Guild speech Ellison spoke favorably of cop killers Mumia Abu-Jamal and \u201cAssata Shakur\u201d (Joanne Chesimard), who was wanted for the murder of New Jersey state trooper Werner Foerster in 1973.",
    "\nChesimard was convicted of that murder but escaped from prison in 1979 and has been on the lam in Cuba since 1984.",
    "\nBryan Burrough\u2019s Days of Rage has a riveting account of Chesimard\u2019s terrorist career.",
    "\nIn 2013, the FBI made Chesimard the first woman named to its Most Wanted Terrorists List.",
    "\nThe FBI has offered a reward of up to $1,000,000 for her capture.",
    "\nYet Ellison prayed for Chesimard in his National Lawyers Guild speech: \u201cI am praying that Castro does not get to the point where he has to really barter with these guys over here because they\u2019re going to get Assata Shakur, they\u2019re going to get a whole lot of other people,\u201d he told the crowd.",
    "\n\u201cI hope the Cuba[n] people can stick to it, because the freedom of some good decent people depends on it.\u201d Ellison\u2019s support for Soliah/Olson in the speech is equally notable.",
    "\nHe denounced law enforcement authorities for prosecuting the attempted murder of police officers.",
    "\nReferring to the days Soliah/Olson had spent in the SLA under the leadership of Donald DeFreeze (\u201cField Marshal Cinque\u201d), Ellison hailed Soliah/Olson as a \u201cblack gang member\u201d and portrayed her as a victim of government persecution.",
    "\nHe described her as one of those who had been \u201cfighting for freedom in the \u201860s and\u201970s\u201d and called for her release.",
    "\nEllison to the contrary notwithstanding, Soliah/Olson pleaded guilty to the crimes charged in Los Angeles and to an additional murder charge in Sacramento.",
    "\nAccording to Ellison, Soliah/Olson was a social justice warrior fighting the good fight.",
    "\nThe case had nothing to do with the attempted murder of police officers; that was but a pretext.",
    "\nSeems he is more than willing to use the police to shield him from the press who will confront him publicly while taking the side of their murderers for political gain.",
    "\nShame on you, Hakim Muhammad!",

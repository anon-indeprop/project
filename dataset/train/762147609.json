    "\nShe issued the warnings in a speech at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank as Iran announced Tuesday that it was formally moving ahead with preparations to increase its nuclear enrichment capacities \u2014 the sharpest response to date by the Islamic republic to Mr. Trump\u2019s pullout from the nuclear accord.",
    "\nIranian officials said the increase, while provocative, does not violate its commitments under the nuclear accord.",
    "\nThe president sent shock waves around the world with his May 8 decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear pact and begin reimposing U.S. sanctions, which the U.S., Europe, China and Russia had collectively lifted in 2015 in exchange for Iran\u2019s promise to curb its suspect nuclear programs and allow international inspections.",

    "\n\u201cSenior U.S. government officials repeatedly testified to Congress that Iranian access to the U.S. financial system was not on the table or part of any deal,\u201d according to a draft copy of the document obtained by The Times.",

    "\nRob Portman, the Ohio Republican who chairs the subcommittee, is set to outline his panel\u2019s findings Wednesday.",
    "\nUnder terms of the nuclear deal, Iran was given the right to reclaim billions of dollars in state assets and bank accounts frozen by international sanctions, but it remained \u201cillegal for U.S. persons, entities, and financial institutions to do business with Iran or parties on behalf of Iran.\u201d\nThe ban included any \u201cintermediary\u201d transactions by U.S. banks to convert currency for Iran \u2014 a development that would have elevated the value of the Iranian assets on the global market and allowed Tehran to more easily move the money through the international banking system.",
    "\nOn the day the nuclear deal was implemented in 2015, Tehran had some $5.7 billion worth of assets at Bank Muscat in Muscat, Oman, according to Senate investigators, who said Tehran moved quickly to request access to the U.S. dollar.",
    "\nOn Tehran\u2019s request, Bank Muscat contacted the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s office of foreign assets control.",
    "\nAccording to the Senate report: \u201cMuscat sought to convert $5.7 billion in Omai rials into euros.",
    "\n[But] because the rial is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the most efficient conversion was with an intermediary step through a U.S. bank using U.S. dollars.\u201d\nObama Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in July 2015 that Iran would \u201ccontinue to be denied access to the [U.S.] financial and commercial market\u201d under the proposed accord, but the Treasury office went ahead with attempts to quietly allow the currency transaction sought by Iran.",
    "\n\u201cOn February 24, 2016, OFAC issued a specific license to Bank Muscat authorizing Iranian assets worth roughly $5.7 billion to flow through the U.S. financial system,\u201d according to the Senate report, which claims the move was made \u201ceven though U.S. sanctions prohibited it.\u201d\nEven as office of foreign assets control officials directly \u201cencouraged two U.S. correspondent banks to convert the funds,\u201d the Treasury Department continued to deny it was working to facilitate the currency transaction, said the report, which cites a 2016 letter from the department to Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida Republican, and Sen. Mark Kirk, Illinois Republican, that contended the Obama \u201cadministration has not been and is not planning to grant Iran access to the U.S. financial system.\u201d\nThe catch, according to Senate investigators, was that neither of the U.S. banks approached by the office of foreign assets control would take on the Iranian currency exchange \u2014 in part because of political concerns over the prospect of being found out to have secretly circumvented the remaining ban on U.S. transactions with the Islamic republic.",
    "\nDespite the Obama administration\u2019s efforts, Iran was ultimately forced to convert its Bank Muscat assets to euros in small increments using European banks and without accessing the U.S. financial system, the Senate investigators said.",
    "\nMr. Portman said in a statement Tuesday night that \u201cthe Obama administration misled the American people and Congress because they were desperate to get a deal with Iran.\u201d\n\u201cDespite claims both before and after the Iran deal was completed that the U.S. financial system would remain off limits, the Obama administration issued a specific license allowing Iran to convert billions of dollars in assets using the U.S. financial system,\u201d Mr. Portman said.",
    "\n\u201cThe only reason this transaction wasn\u2019t executed was because two U.S. banks refused, even though the administration asked them to help convert the money.\u201d\nSuch sanctions, he added, \u201care a vital foreign policy tool, and the U.S. government should never work to actively undermine their enforcement or effectiveness.\u201d"

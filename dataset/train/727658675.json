    "\nBishop Eleganti\u2019s support of the profession comes just three days after Bishop Athanasius Schneider, auxiliary of Astana, Kazakstan, invited the world\u2019s bishops to sign the document and join in raising a common voice in defense of the sanctity and the indissolubility of marriage.",
    "\n\u201cGod decides the time, and the time will come when the Pope and the episcopacy again will proclaim, with all clarity, unambiguity and beauty, the sanctity of marriage, and of the family, and of the Eucharist,\u201d Schneider told LifesiteNews in an exclusive Jan. 15 interview.",
    "\nRaising a Common Voice\nIn conversation with LifeSiteNews, Schneider said greater public support of the document from the world\u2019s 5,000 bishops would be \u201ca stronger voice for professing the constant truths of the Church, and it would be a beautiful common voice defending the sanctity and the indissolubility of marriage in the midst of a real neo-pagan society where divorce has become a plague and where sexual depravity is increasingly spreading.\u201d\nThe Profession of Immutable Truths about Sacramental Marriage was issued by three Kazakh Ordinaries, including Bishop Schneider, in early January.",

    "\nSome of these norms, Schneider told LifeSiteNews, give \u201cimplicit approval\u201d of divorce and of sexual activity outside a valid marriage.",
    "\nSuch a reading is causing \u201crampant confusion,\u201d will spread \u201ca plague of divorce\u201d in the Church, and is \u201calien\u201d to the Church\u2019s entire faith and Tradition, the three bishops said in the profession.",

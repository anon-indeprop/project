    "The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition\n\nOf that book, no less than Robert Royal\u2014signaling growing alarm over the Bergoglian Debacle in the Catholic mainstream\u2014 has written : \u201cAbout 90 percent of it is simply incontrovertible, and cannot help but clarify who Francis is and what he\u2019s about.\u201d And the picture that emerges in stark relief in The Dictator Pope, as Life Site News reports , is that of \u201ca power-hungry, manipulative dictator, [who] celebrated the abdication of Benedict XVI\u201d because he knew what it meant: that the plan to give him the Keys of Peter in 2005 would finally come to fruition in 2013.",
    "\n\u201cWe elected you to make reforms, not to smash everything!\u201d Thus is Cardinal Leonardi Sandri, a fellow Argentinian and a supporter of Pope Francis at the conclave of 2013, reliably reported literally to have screamed at Pope Francis behind closed doors in the Vatican.",
    "\nSandri would be one of a number of Bergoglian partisans at the conclave who are now said to be experiencing \u201cbuyer\u2019s remorse,\u201d as documented most recently in the explosive best-seller The Dictator Pope .",
    "\n\"When the shepherd becomes a wolf, the first duty of the flock is to defend itself.",
    "\nThe true children of Holy Church, at such times, are those who walk by the light of their Baptism, not the cowardly souls who, under the specious pretext of submission to the powers that be, delay their opposition to the enemy in the hope of receiving instructions which are neither necessary nor desirable.\"",
    "\nFrancis, writes Royal, \u201chas little use for established procedures, precedents, even legal structures within the Church\u2026.",
    "\nWhen the head of the Church himself does not much feel bound by the tradition or impartial laws he has inherited, what then?\u201d What then indeed?",
    "\nThe Dictator Pope even feels at liberty to demand that the Lord\u2019s Prayer be changed to reflect his dissatisfaction with God\u2019s words: \u201cAnd lead us not into temptation [et ne nos inducas in tentationem],\u201d which Francis has decided, after 2,000 years, is a \u201cnot a good translation.\u201d Apparently lost on Francis, given the disordered m\u00e9lange of bits and pieces of things he has read that constitutes his theology, is the distinction between sin, a culpable act, and temptation, which arises from concupiscence or what Saint Thomas called the fomes, or the fleshly inclination to sin, which grace enables us to control by the rule of reason over the passions.",
    "\nBut now we are witness to the single worst act of tyranny in the entire history of the papacy.",
    "\nThe Church has seen a number of Popes who have abused their power, Alexander VI being the most popularly known example.",
    "\nBut never, before Francis, has there been a Pope who dared to tyrannize the Magisterium itself by attempting to bend it to his errant personal opinions.",
    "\nBy publication in the Acta Apostolicae Sedis (AAS), Francis has officially declared that the \u201cauthentic Magisterium\u201d includes the guidelines of the bishops of Buenos Aires for the implementation of Chapter 8 of Amoris Laetitia (AL), which he expressly approved in his letter to them as the only correct interpretation of his will.",
    "\nThe guidelines have been published in the AAS along with Francis\u2019s private missive, which is suddenly declared to be \u201can apostolic letter.\u201d\nThe normalist narrative has just been stripped of any colorable argument that nothing is too terribly amiss with this pontificate.",

    "\n\nIn other more complex circumstances, and when it is not possible to obtain a declaration of nullity, the aforementioned option may not, in fact, be viable.",
    "\nNonetheless, it is equally possible to undertake a journey of discernment\u2026.",

    "\nnotes 336 and 351).",
    "\nAs Francis would have it, then, the \u201cauthentic Magisterium\u201d has just flatly contradicted itself for the first time in two millennia:\nThe admission of public adulterers in \u201csecond marriages\u201d to Holy Communion, which John Paul II, in line with all of Tradition, called \u201c intrinsically impossible \u201d given their objective state in life, is now deemed possible depending on circumstances\u2014that is, situation ethics applied to violations of the Sixth Commandment.",
    "\n\nThe requirement that people embroiled in such unions commit to living in continence before they can be absolved and partake of the Blessed Sacrament\u2014a moral norm binding \u201c without exception \u201d because it is rooted in divine law\u2014is suddenly demoted to a mere \u201cproposal\u201d that may not be \u201cfeasible\u201d or \u201cviable\u201d in \u201cthe concrete circumstances of the couple.\u201d\nA valid annulment of a truly invalid marriage, the sine qua non for entering into marital relations with another purported spouse, is now dispensed with in \u201cmore complex circumstances\u2026 when it is not possible to obtain a declaration of nullity,\u201d the way thus being opened to de facto divorce in the Catholic Church.",
    "\nThe meaningless slogan \u201cjourney of discernment\u201d cloaks a naked authorization for the official toleration of adulterous sexual relations in the Church\u2019s sacramental life.",
    "\nNo less than a Roman Pontiff lends his name to the outrageous claim that children resulting from an adulterous relationship, blithely referred to as a \u201cnew union,\u201d could be \u201cdamaged\u201d if the partners in adultery were required to cease their adultery in order to be absolved and receive Holy Communion\u2014evidently because the \u201cnew union\u201d would dissolve without adulterous sexual relations and there could be a second divorce!",
    "\nThis appeared in the last Print-Edition of The Remnant.",
    "\nSee what else you missed.",
    "\nSubscribe Today!",
    "\nAs recently as seventeen years ago, during the reign of John Paul II, the Pontifical Council for the Interpretation of Legislative texts reaffirmed the immutable truth reflected in Canon 915, which prohibits the administration of Holy Communion to those \u201cwho obstinately persist in manifest grave sin.\u201d That prohibition, declared the Pontifical Council, applies to the divorced and \u201cremarried\u201d not as a matter of mere disciplinary law subject to revocation or modification, but rather \u201cis derived from divine law and transcends the domain of positive ecclesiastical laws; [and] the latter cannot introduce legislative changes which would oppose the doctrine of the Church.\u201d\nFrancis, however, has purported to do nothing less invent exceptions to divine law that oppose the doctrine of the Church.",
    "\nThe attempt is void, of course, and the appellation \u201cauthentic Magisterium\u201d is fraudulent.",
    "\nBut the consequences of this Pope\u2019s toying with the teaching office of the Church to advance half-baked theological notions, such as \u201cdiscernment\u201d (a term he borrows from St. Ignatius of Loyola but strips of its original meaning) are catastrophic.",
    "\nOver the past year, Cardinal Burke and a few other members of the hierarchy have called upon Francis to \u201cclarify\u201d his intention respecting AL.",
    "\nThat clarification has now been given: Francis intends, if it were possible, to change the unchangeable teaching of the Church regarding an irrevocable moral norm rooted in divine law.",
    "\nEven if the attempt is void and of no effect before man and God\u2014an immoral law is no law at all\u2014Francis clearly means to impose his will by fiat, daring invoke the \u201cauthentic Magisterium\u201d to cloak his absurd novelties.",
    "\nNo Pope before him has ever dared to do such a thing.",
    "\nSo now it must be asked: Where are the cardinals and the bishops?",
    "\nWith one or two noble (however inconsistent) exceptions, their response to the Bergoglian Debacle thus far ranges from silence, to active complicity, to\u2014at best\u2014hand-wringing over the increasingly chaotic state of the Church while begging the Pope to \u201cclarify\u201d his already perfectly clear intentions.",
    "\nAt this point, continued pleading for a Bergoglian \u201cclarification\u201d can only give rise to an impression of disingenuousness, whereas continued silence about the papal origin of this ongoing catastrophe is a standing rebuke to all the hierarchs who know what we all know: that at the epicenter of the chaos is the most wayward Pope the Church has ever had to endure.",
    "\nContinued inaction while the laity and a few good priests are left to themselves to defend, as best they can, the constant teaching of the Church against the abuses of a tyrant on the Chair of Peter threatens the hierarchs with a legacy of shame and a terrible accountability before the Just Judge.",
    "\nTheir failure to defend the Faith by standing up to the one they know full well is attacking it almost daily lends itself ever more to an indictment for timidity in the face of unprecedented danger to the Church and the cause of the Gospel of which they are divinely charged to be leaders.",
    "\nThe time for \u201cprudence\u201d is long past.",
    "\nPrudence now gives way to mere pusillanimity.",
    "\nThe time for hierarchical action is now, before the damage to the Church becomes irreparable.",
    "\nThe members of a hierarchy seemingly cowed by a papal tyranny the Church has never before seen must rise immediately and give a courageous answer to the challenge posed long ago by Monsignor Klaus Gamber, when an already monumental ecclesial crisis was still in what can now can be seen as merely a preliminary stage:\nWhere in our Church are the leaders who can show us the right path?",
    "\nWhere are the bishops courageous enough to cut out the cancerous growth of modernist theology that has implanted itself and is festering within the celebration of even the most sacred mysteries, before the cancer spreads and causes even greater damage?",
    "\nWhat we need today is a new Athanasius, a new Basil, bishops like those who in the fourth century fought courageously against Arianism when almost the whole of Christendom had succumbed to heresy.",
    "\nWill none of the hierarchs rise to defend the Church as \u201ca new Athanasius, a new Basil\u201d?",
    "\nEven the best among them continue to limit themselves to generalized lamentations at conferences or in interviews about the parlous state of the Church or at most the \u201cconfusion\u201d Francis has caused by not \u201cclarifying\u201d precisely what he has just clarified.",
    "\nThey avoid the absolutely necessary direct and public exposure of error at its source.",
    "\nThat error threatens to overwhelm the Church while they do little more than fret about a situation whose self-evident cause\u2014a reckless Pope in love with his own ideas and filled with contempt for Tradition\u2014they seem incapable of identifying.",
    "\nConcerned clergy and laity throughout the Catholic world are doing what they can according to their stations.",
    "\nBut in the midst of that \u201cfinal battle\u201d over marriage and family of which Sister Lucia warned the late Cardinal Caffarra in light of the Third Secret of Fatima, within the human element of the Church only the cardinals and the bishops possess the divinely bestowed power to repel an assault on marriage, family and the very integrity of the Faith that is now, for the first time in Church history, being led by a Roman Pontiff.",
    "\nThis undeniably apocalyptic development imposes upon the hierarchs\u2014first and foremost in the Church\u2014the duty to act.",
    "\nTrue love for the Church, indeed true charity toward Francis himself, requires of them nothing less than what was required of Saint Paul when the first Pope fell into error that jeopardized the very mission of the Church: that Peter be withstood to his face (Gal.",
    "\n2:11).",
    "\nMay Our Lady of Fatima intercede to obtain for them the grace of fortitude to do what must be done and what only they can do.",
    "\nOur hopes and prayers are with them as the foremost instruments of divine providence in the ecclesia Dei adflicta.",
    "\nOur Lady of Fatima, intercede for us!"

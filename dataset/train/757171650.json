    "\nEbola is most feared for the internal and external bleeding it can cause in victims owing to damage done to blood vessels.",
    "\nThe Mail reports that health workers have recorded confirmed, probable and suspected cases of Ebola in three health zones of Congo\u2019s Equateur province, and have identified 432 people who may have had contact with the disease, the WHO said.",
    "\nSupplies sent to Congo included more than 300 body bags for safe burials in affected communities.",

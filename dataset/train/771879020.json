    "\nWhat does all this mean?",
    "\nWell, it's pretty simple, and I highly recommend the Wired article, which is quite lengthy and has lots of information, but what this does is demonstrates that the genie is out of the bottle and there is just no way for gun grabbing Communists the world over to be able to truly enforce their unlawful acts of fun gun confiscation.",
    "\nWhy?",
    "\nBecause now, anyone with access to the internet and a 3D printer can print their very own gun that is unregistered.",

    "\nAnd we aren't just talking a rigid looking one-shot handgun.",
    "\nWe're talking ARs, 1911s and a host of other guns.",

    "\nTherefore, the government still believes it has a right to regulate certain arms, which it does not have authority to do.",
    "\n\"This doesn\u2019t put the rifle in everyone\u2019s hand, but it does that in essence\" he added.",
    "\n\"The DNA of our culture is preserved.",

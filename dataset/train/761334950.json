    "A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?",
    "\n\nThe meeting covered Carmels of the Teresian, Discalced, reform from Germany, five areas of Spain, three from France, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria, Croatia and the Holy Land [1] .",
    "\nThe reports from each region showed that many of the provisions found in Cor orans were already in place: federations with broad powers, including financial control and combined formation courses, \u201creligious assistant\u201d priests appointed by the federation and overseeing individual monasteries and superiors giving up their authority to the federations.",
    "\nGiven that this was 2009, it is clear that the plans to force all contemplative monasteries in the world into this disastrous European mould were well under way long before Pope Benedict was even considering resigning.",
    "\nToday I\u2019ve received an interesting document issued by the Carmelite Order in Europe following a meeting of the \u201cFederations of Discalced Carmelite Nuns of Europe & the Holy Land\u201d in Avila, February 2009.",
    "\nAs a snapshot of the current condition of Carmelite monastic life after it had been completely \u201cfederated,\u201d it paints a depressing picture; but as a demonstration of what \u201cfederations\u201d are likely to achieve once Cor orans is implemented universally, it clangs in the mind like a funeral bell.",
    "\nReconciled to managed extinction\nThe report shows average ages of nuns between 65 and 80, \u201cinfirmary Carmels,\u201d nuns in state nursing homes, entire communities living in care facilities and half the Carmels with no one in formation.",
    "\nSolutions offered are equally uniform: heaped-up bureaucracy, common formation courses between monasteries developed by \u201creligious psychologists,\u201d ever more powers handed to federations.",

    "\nVery little is said of any efforts being made to increase vocational outreach using the internet or through diocesan contacts.",
    "\nAnd perhaps most telling of all, not one word is offered of applying any systematic religious solutions; no one is suggesting increased prayer or fasting, Rosary campaigns or novenas in what has to be the Carmelite Order\u2019s most desperate hour.",
    "\nNothing is said of increased intensity of devotion to the charism, study of the foundress or returning to sources, still less of strengthening the Carmelites\u2019 traditional independent self-governance or reconsidering the wisdom of \u201cthe path taken\u201d.",
    "\nIndeed, in one case in Spain, the sisters themselves advocate abandoning traditional Teresian autonomy altogether.",

    "\nThere have been two amalgamations in recent years and another one involving three Carmels is in process.",
    "\nTwo communities at present are living together in one monastery as a temporary measure.\u201d\nThe case of the Netherlands is downright bizarre; sisters so old that even the federation structures are breaking down.",
    "\nOnly one fully autonomous functioning Carmel still exists in the Netherlands, and the remains of four entire communities are living in a single care home run by religious brothers.",
    "\nBut in this situation, the \u201csolution\u201d undertaken has been an elaborate bureaucratic reshuffle, including gaining approval from Rome, for \u201ca completely new structure,\u201d whose main task, no doubt, will be the making of funeral arrangements and disposing of library books.",
    "\nThe atmosphere is weirdly resigned \u2013 one federation report recommended simply \u201cforgetting the numbers\u201d \u2013 with many notes of mutual congratulation over \u201cunity,\u201d the creating of \u201clinks\u201d and the \u201cbuilding of trust\u201d and \u201cdialogue\u201d between communities.",
    "\nThe report from Belgium \u2013 federated in 1997, average age 73 with one sister in formation for 11 monasteries \u2013 states tersely that their biggest problem is \u201cageing\u201d but under \u201cpossible solutions\u201d says only, \u201cWe want to continue along the path we have begun.\u201d\nIt is only in the report from Croatia where the problem changes abruptly from aging nuns and no vocations to too many vocations with not enough room[2].",
    "\nIt is also notable that it is only in the Croatian report that Christ gets a direct mention.",
    "\nFederation of Croatia & Bosnia-Herzegovina: 82 nuns in 5 convents, with an average age of 47, and eleven in formation.",
    "\nThis outlier differs from the Western European federations in several respects, notably that it was only federated in 2002.",
    "\nBut the effects of the federating/formation courses are already being felt: \u201cNowadays, two monasteries have difficulty because of a lack of vocations.\u201d\nPath taken: Have made a foundation in Albania; however this community is not federated.",
    "\nFrom the beginning, our Association has organized formation courses for the younger sisters as well as courses of permanent formation.",

    "\nNowadays, two monasteries have difficulty because of a lack of vocations.",
    "\nPossible solutions: We do all what is in our hands in the area of the vocational promotion, collaborating in this way with Christ who calls by his Spirit.",
    "\nThese self-generated reports were made in response to a questionnaire set out for the meeting.",
    "\nAll speak of nothing but bureaucratic responses: shared \u201cformation courses,\u201d meetings of superiors, amalgamations and suppression of houses and finally \u201ccare homes\u201d and houses given over entirely as infirmaries.",

    "\nIt is important to continue to protect the interests of our Federation in the most responsible and careful way, so that all the sisters, even those advanced in years, can continue to live their life in Carmel.",
    "\nDefinitive permission came at the 25th of February.",
    "\n~~~\nGiven this incredible picture of a Carmelite Order in the last rattle of its death throes, the rest of the summaries of speeches given at the meeting in Avila read as outright surreal, leaving us to wonder if any of these people are attached in any way to reality.",
    "\nSr. Enrica Rosanna, the representative of the Vatican\u2019s Congregation for Religious told them that the \u201ctwo great challenges to our contemplative life\u201d are \u201cthe challenge of globalization and the challenge of irrelevancy.\u201d She warned the nuns against bringing vocations from other countries to keep their monasteries alive, dropping a hint about what now seems to be a particular obsession of the Congregation.",
    "\nCor orans would take this subject up definitively in 2018:\nThe nuns were exhorted to \u201cstay awake to welcome the dawn\u201d of a bright new future:\n\u201cThese are difficult and uncertain times, but it is also the time to stay awake as the new dawn is already announcing itself.\u201d \u201cOur aim must be to be open to the future.",
    "\nWe should not forget that we are following in the tradition of Teresa of Jesus and in the tradition of all those who have followed in her footsteps.",
    "\nIt is a wide road that opens up before us.",
    "\nWe must be women of hope and faith.",
    "\nWe must always believe that God is the one who directs history.",
    "\nFrom this derives our task, to be creative and, at the same time, faithful (creative fidelity).\u201d [emphasis in the original.]",
    "\nWhile there can be no doubt that the impending total extinction of the Carmelite Order in Western Europe was foremost in the minds of the nuns present, it seems that the issue was simply not addressed out loud by the representatives of the bureaucracy.",
    "\nInstead, Sr. Enrica, after this bizarre and cryptic comment, spoke of the \u201cproblems and difficulties that we can encounter\u201d in discernment of mostly non-existent vocations, including \u201cconsumerism, modern means of communication, difficulties in creating a stable personality, autonomy of the young, the need to be always supported, the ideology of subjectivism.\u201d\nWhat are these people smoking?",
    "\nGiven that this was three years or more from the abdication of Benedict and the installation of the New Paradigm of Francis/Kasper, one wonders what this \u201cnew dawn\u201d was actually about.",
    "\nPerhaps a useful question for one of the nuns present could have been, \u201cA \u2018new dawn\u2019 of what, exactly?\u201d This kind of coded language has been popular with the progressivist faction in the Church since the 1960s, when the expectation was for the installation of a totally new Church.",
    "\nWas Sr. Enrica somehow anticipating the fulfillment of those hippie-era dreams in the years to come?",
    "\nIt is certainly clear from Francis\u2019 first acts as pope that he had dealing with conservative and Traditionalist nuns high on his list of priorities.",
    "\nHis first appointment, no more than three weeks after the Conclave was Jose Rodrigues Carballo, the Religious Congregation\u2019s Secretary and \u2013 given the scandal that erupted on his leaving them \u2013 the financial wrecking ball of the Franciscan Friars Minor.",
    "\nThe first task Francis gave Carballo was the demolition of the Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate.",
    "\nCertainly this record of the European Carmelites\u2019 meeting is jammed with hints that Cor orans was on the way.",
    "\nOn the final day of the meeting, the \u201ctheme for the day\u201d was offered by then-Father General Luis Arostegui: \u201cGovernment: the need for change.",
    "\nAutonomy and Association; autonomy and Fr.",
    "\nGeneral; other solutions to government.\u201d\nThe devolution of authority of superiors of individual monasteries to federations was obviously on someone\u2019s mind, as was a plan to see to it that monasteries change superiors frequently: \u201cEssential autonomy can fail due to the relationships within the community: abuses by permanent superiors who decide on the freedom and decisions of the community,\u201d the Father General warned.",
    "\nAnd there were certainly hints that a general re-organisation of structures of authority was in the works.",
    "\nA common tactic of politicians who want to initiate changes is to \u201cask questions\u201d rather than make suggestions, and Arostegui asked some very leading questions indeed in this closing address:\n\u201cWho discerns the existence or not of vital autonomy; is it the community or chosen people?",
    "\n\u201cAre there instances that work well within the Church which balance autonomy in a way that can be helpful in these situations?",
    "\n\u201cAt the time of St. Teresa she was an example of someone balanced.",
    "\nStability is one reason [for autonomy], but is stability understood in such a way that it can obstruct the spirit of mission and your availability to the Order and to the Church?",
    "\n\u201cThe valiant and prophetic initiative of Pope Pius XII to create Associations and Federations opened up contemplative life, though it was also thought that it could harm cloister and autonomy.",
    "\nCan such essential autonomy continue as it is?",
    "\n\u201c50 years ago there was stability.",
    "\nHow do we conceive today the relationship between autonomy and Federation-Association and between autonomy and Fr.",
    "\nGeneral?",
    "\n\u201cCould there be other forms of government?\u201d\nFollowing the Father General\u2019s address are notes from the language groups, including the following:\n\u201cWhile some communities do not want their autonomy to be touched, and have certain fears of \u2018external\u2019 interference, others want a more moderate and flexible autonomy that, without going to the Congregation would have a juridical form, where the President with her Council can intervene in extreme cases that today we watch with pain, our hands tied.",
    "\nThough we want these legal channels to be established, it must remain clear what the limits of the Federation Council are, in order to avoid abuses of power on the part of the same.\u201d \u201c...The absence of vital autonomy is also noticed when\u2026 the same person remains prioress for years.\u201d \u201c...We need criteria that expand number 203 of our Constitutions and clarify vital autonomy.",
    "\nWe perceive that there is a shortage of authority figures.",
    "\nWe do not want new figures but rather those that already exist (Associations, [federation] Presidents, Provincials...) be empowered in a legal way (canonically) to help communities in difficulty, for the mission to discern, to counsel, to accompany.\u201d \u201c...We are also concerned for those communities not affiliated to Federations, we see that we should be close to them.\u201d\nMaybe this summary document of 2009 can give us an idea what to expect from Rome in 2018, now that the \u201cprogressivist\u201d faction in the Vatican is in the ascendancy and is free to act without restriction.",
    "\nWhat comes clear comparing this document to Cor orans is that the Vatican\u2019s machinery has long been at work forcing a uniform and essentially bureaucratic, heavily authoritarian and legalistic vision of contemplative life on anyone who fails sufficiently to resist it.",
    "\nAnd with the statistics offered at this meeting we can see clearly where this road leads.",
    "\nSo many Catholics in the last 40 years assumed that under the \u201cconservatives\u201d John Paul II and Benedict XVI at least the Vatican was \u201conside.\u201d At least in Rome they understood the terrible threat of the Bolshie VaticanTwoist revolutionaries.",
    "\nBut this report of 2009 shows a clear picture of a Roman congregation determined to see the revolution through to its inevitable conclusion.",
    "\n_____________________\n[1] An aside that will perhaps be noteworthy to traditionalist readers is the little comment in the report on the difficulty of having a liturgical observance between all the disparate nations represented at the meeting.",
    "\n\u201cEucharist and Lauds in Spanish.",
    "\nFr.",
    "\nIsidore D\u2019Silva had prepared a booklet with the liturgy for each day.",
    "\nEach psalm was in a different language, and was prepared by the corresponding liturgical group.",
    "\nHowever, having the text in front of us made it easier to follow the recitation in other languages.",
    "\nThe end result was that we could all join in the liturgy.",
    "\nWe were all united in the praise of the Spirit who had brought us there together from different languages and nations.\u201d\n[2] Solution: new foundations, the spreading of the Carmelite charism into new territories.",
    "\n[3] This includes all sisters up to final profession, not just postulants and novices."

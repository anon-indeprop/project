    "SO MUCH FOR MERCY & DIALOGUE: Member of Vatican International Theological Commission Sacked for Questioning Pope of Mercy & Dialogue\n\nThe Catholic Twitterverse is alive today with criticism of the USCCB\u2019s decision to sack Fr.",
    "\nThomas Weinandy, the former head of their doctrinal office.",
    "\nIt took a matter of hours for the brave defenders of the status quo to leap into action against the mild Franciscan friar\u2019s polite plea to Pope Francis to defend the Catholic Faith and faithful.",
    "\nOr at least to stop attacking them.",
    "\nIn a letter made public November 1st, Fr.",
    "\nWeinandy, a former chief of staff for the U.S. Bishops\u2019 Committee on Doctrine and a member of the Vatican\u2019s International Theological Commission, warned Pope Francis that he has caused \u201cchronic confusion\u201d among the faithful and bishops.",
    "\n\n\n\nHe wrote to the pope, \u201cTo teach with such an intentional lack of clarity inevitably risks sinning against the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of truth.\u201d He added that Catholics are \u201cdisconcerted\u201d by the appointment of bishops \u201cwho seem not merely open to those who hold views counter to Christian belief, but who support and even defend them.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn an interview yesterday with John Allen\u2019s Crux, he added, more prophetically than he had perhaps intended, \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone can, or should, associate my letter with the USCCB or the American bishops.",
    "\nNeither was involved in my writing the letter, and its publication will be news to them.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBishops are quick learners,\u201d he wrote in his letter, \u201cand what many have learned from your pontificate is not that you are open to criticism, but that you resent it,\u201d claiming that many bishops don\u2019t speak out publicly for fear they will be \u201cmarginalized or worse.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd sure enough, within hours of making his letter public, we learned that Fr.",
    "\nWeinandy had been given the boot.",
    "\nOf course, the Twitterverse is busy commenting on the irony: how a man expressing grave concerns that there is an atmosphere of fear of being punished for expressing grave concerns, was immediately fired.",
    "\n\n\n\nPerhaps the most astonishing aspect of this little incident is just how completely blind the US bishops \u2013 as with nearly all the episcopate \u2013 are to what political analysts call the \u201coptics\u201d.",
    "\nPolitical consultants often ask: how does it look?",
    "\nAnd it looks extremely bad.",
    "\nAs though the fog of irony weren\u2019t thick enough, in response to the outrage from Catholics, the USCCB has done what all the other members of Pope Francis\u2019 cabal have done and started blocking critics from its Twitter account.",
    "\nWhich, it must be said, only proves Fr.",
    "\nWeinandy\u2019s point once again.",
    "\n\n\n\nSome of the criticism has been unusually sharp.",
    "\nFr.",
    "\nHunwicke wrote this afternoon, \u201cThis cheap and vulgar ritual humiliation exemplifies the extent to which P[ope] F[rancis] is presiding over a bully-boy Church in which midget bishops and minicardinals compete to defeat each other in the sycophancy stakes.",
    "\nJust as Tom Weinandy has, in effect, just said.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs I write this, the outrage is doing the opposite of dying down, and is surely a sign of how fed up Catholics \u2013 even those who would never identify themselves as Traditionalists \u2013 have become with this pope and his cadre of episcopal bullies.",
    "\nIn his letter, Fr.",
    "\nWeinandy made a point of stating that he is not signatory to the Filial Correction or any other public declaration against Pope Francis\u2019 agenda.",
    "\n\n\n\nIn fact, a former student of his wrote to me today saying,\n\u201cI see that Fr.",
    "\nThomas Weinandy has been squashed.",
    "\nHe was one of my professors in Patristics at Oxford and he was one of the most mild-mannered, least confrontational, kindest academics one could have hoped to meet.",
    "\nTo me, the fact that he has chosen to write to express his concern about the crisis in the church and the papacy is very significant.",
    "\n\nHe is neither a traditionalist, nor a controversialist, but a humble and straightforward Friar who is clear-thinking and entirely loyal to the Church and Her teaching.",
    "\nI would be surprised now if we were not see more of this sort of letter/exercise of conscience.",
    "\nI imagine that it\u2019s going to become harder and harder for men of conscience and position to sit on the fence.\u201d\nWhen I posted it, this assessment was backed up by Joseph Shaw, the head of the UK\u2019s Latin Mass Society and the spokesman for the Filial Correction, who wrote, \u201cThis is absolutely right.",
    "\nNot a man to seek out confrontation.\u201d\n\nThe Crux piece offered a succinct bullet point list of Fr.",
    "\nWeinandy\u2019s concerns.",
    "\nHe said the pope is\u2026\nFostering \u201cchronic confusion.\u201d\n\u201cDemeaning\u201d the importance of doctrine.",
    "\nAppointing bishops who \u201cscandalize\u201d believers with dubious \u201cteaching and pastoral practice.\u201d\nGiving prelates who object the impression they\u2019ll be \u201cmarginalized or worse\u201d if they speak out.",
    "\nCausing faithful Catholics to \u201close confidence in their supreme shepherd.\u201d\nOur friend Edward Pentin has reproduced the full text of the letter at the National Catholic Register which is definitely worth a read.",
    "\nFr.",
    "\nWeinandy sent the letter to the pope on July 31, the Feast of St. Ignatius of Loyola.",
    "\nLike the Dubia cardinals, he said he made it public only after the pope had ignored it for months.",
    "\n\nNotable in his critique is its distinct pastoral flavour, his concern on the effect the situation is having on ordinary people.",
    "\nThe pope, he said, seems \u201cto censor and even mock\u201d critics of Amoris Laetitia for their desire to interpret it in keeping with Catholic teaching, and in doing so is committing a \u201ckind of calumny\u2026alien to the nature of the Petrine ministry.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Crux, Weinandy said he is not afraid of reprisals but \u201cmore concerned about the good that my letter might do.\u201d The letter \u201cexpresses the concerns of many more people than just me, ordinary people who\u2019ve come to me with their questions and apprehensions.",
    "\nI wanted them to know that I listened.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have done what I believe God wanted me to do,[1]\u201d he said.",
    "\n\nIn fact, Fr.",
    "\nWeinandy has bolstered my own \u201cGreat Clarifier\u201d theory, saying that this pontificate, and the lack of response to it from priests and bishops, is being allowed by God in order to reveal \u201cjust how weak is the faith of many within the Church,\u201d He added that Francis has revealed that many in the Church \u201chold harmful theological and pastoral views.\u201d\n\nWhich inevitably brings to mind other responses that have not been quite so clear, nor so pastoral.",
    "\n\nWhen Cardinal Muller was removed abruptly from his position as head of the CDF, the conservative Catholic world wailed that it was another case of a \u201cgood\u201d prelate being got rid of.",
    "\nAnd it seems clear from the way it was done, and the way Francis treated Muller in general, that he was indeed got rid of.",
    "\nBut his depiction by conservative writers as a beleaguered champion of Catholic orthodoxy persecuted by the regime for his faithfulness betrays a somewhat selective memory and short attention span.",
    "\nEd Pentin has a long file of interviews and articles about Muller that clearly show his complete inability to make up his mind whose side he\u2019s on.",
    "\n\nA quick examination of Muller\u2019s interviews and statements reveal an irresolute and ultimately calculating mind of a man who is \u2013 so I am told by sources close to him \u2013 motivated mainly by a puerile desire to be approved of by the \u201ccool kids\u201d in the Vatican, on the one hand, and an unshakeable conviction of his own theological brilliance on the other.",
    "\n\nMost recently, on October 30th, Crux quoted him under the headline, \u201cCardinal Muller backs Pope Francis against critics of \u2018Amoris Laetitia\u2019\u201d in which the former head of the CDF has at last climbed on board the Kasperian train on reception of Communion for unrepentant adulterers.",
    "\n\nSignaling furiously with the trendy FrancisChurch buzzwords and even trendier blithering incoherence, Muller writes that \u201cmitigating factors in guilt,\u201d can lead, couples in \u201can uncertain marital situation\u201d through a \u201cpath of repentance\u201d \u2013 always \u201caccompanied\u201d by an exquisitely sensitive confessor \u2013 to a point where the reception of Communion is no longer sinful.",
    "\nPresumably because adultery itself is no longer sinful.",
    "\nOr sacrilege either, I guess.",
    "\nOr something.",
    "\nSomehow the \u201cnew evangelization\u201d is involved in this, though it\u2019s unclear how exactly it makes adultery and sacrilege OK. Also, it\u2019s very important to fulfill the Sunday Mass obligation, and as everyone knows, one can\u2019t possibly go to Mass on a Sunday without receiving Communion.",
    "\n\nWe hear again, as we did incessantly from the Kasperians at the Synods, about the hard case of the poor, poor woman who has been abandoned by the first husband, and who \u201cfinds no other way out than to entrust oneself to a kind-hearted person,\u201d \u2026 with whom, I guess, she has also no choice but to have sexual relations.",
    "\nBecause of kind-heartedness.",
    "\n\nAnyway, the result of this is a \u201cmarriage-like relationship\u201d about which confessors have to be very careful not to say mean things.",
    "\nOr be too \u201cextreme\u201d.",
    "\nIt\u2019s very important for him to avoid a \u201ccheap adaptation to the relativistic Zeitgeist,\u201d on one side, and a \u201ccold application of the dogmatic commandments and the canonical rules,\u201d on the other.",
    "\nBecause that could be too polarizing.",
    "\nAnd mean.",
    "\n\nAnd anyway, sins of the flesh aren\u2019t the worst things ever.",
    "\nThere are, like, \u201cdifferent levels\u201d of gravity, you know?",
    "\nAnd, like, it depends on the type of sin, right?",
    "\n\u201cSpirit\u2019s sins\u201d like spiritual pride and avarice and stuff, are worse than \u201csins of the flesh,\u201d you know?",
    "\nWhich are, like, only a result of \u201chuman weakness,\u201d right?",
    "\n\nApparently the real problem with this whole thing has been that the Kasperian kerfuffle has totally been blown way, way, WAY out of proportion, and the \u201cpolarization\u201d it has caused has been \u201cregrettable\u201d.",
    "\nThe question of Communion for divorced and civilly \u201cremarried\u201d Catholics, he said, has been \u201cfalsely elevated to the rank of a decisive question of Catholicism and a measure of ideological comparison in order to decide whether one is conservative or liberal, in favor or against the pope.\u201d\n\nFor years under Pope Benedict, Muller was engaged in an open war with the German episcopate who insisted that they were going to allow Communion for the divorced and remarried, no matter what Rome said, even threatening to go into schism if they didn\u2019t get their way[2].",
    "\n\nMuller, with little backing from Pope Benedict \u2013 who appeared content to allow his CDF prefect and the Germans shout out their differences \u2013 and with outright opposition from Francis, did indeed strive to hold the line.",
    "\nThe fact that Francis orchestrated the Synods to undermine him was certainly not his fault.",
    "\nAnd it is difficult to imagine anyone being in a worse position than he was at the time.",
    "\n\nBut since then, Muller has demonstrated very little of his former grit, instead attempting from one day to the next to appease both sides.",
    "\nReportedly removed from CDF \u2013 and of course lionized by \u201cconservatives\u201d \u2013 for his mild and equivocating opposition to Amoris Laetitia, Muller has gone back and forth in what can easily be seen as a desperate attempt to find friends in both camps.",
    "\nWith this in mind one could be forgiven for not taking his October 30th essay too seriously.",
    "\n\nPerhaps one of the good effects to come from Fr.",
    "\nWeinandy\u2019s persecution will be to demonstrate how a pastor of the Catholic Church is supposed to act.",
    "\nAs my friend said, maybe \u201cit\u2019s going to become harder and harder for men of conscience and position to sit on the fence,\u201d assuming there are any left.",
    "\n\nCatch Hilary's regular column in The Remnant's Print/E-edition.",
    "\nSubscribe Today!",
    "\n[1] In this interview, Fr.",
    "\nWeinandy gave a remarkable story of how his prayer for a \u201csign\u201d that he ought to write the letter was very specifically answered: \u201cIf you want me to write something, you have to give me a clear sign,\u201d Weinandy recalls saying.",
    "\n\u201cTomorrow morning, I\u2019m going to Saint Mary Major\u2019s to pray, and then I am going to Saint John Lateran.",
    "\nAfter that, I\u2019m coming back to Saint Peter\u2019s to have lunch with a seminary friend of mine.\u201d \u201cDuring that interval, I must meet someone that I know but have not seen in a very long time, and would never expect to see in Rome at this time.",
    "\nThat person cannot be from the United States, Canada or Great Britain.",
    "\nMoreover, that person has to say to me, \u2018Keep up the good writing\u2019.\u201d Weinandy said, exactly that happened the next day, in a chance meeting with an archbishop he\u2019d known a long time ago but not seen for over twenty years, who congratulated him for a book on the Incarnation and then said the right words, \u201cKeep up the good writing.\u201d \u201cThere was no longer any doubt in my mind that Jesus wanted me to write something,\u201d Weinandy said.",
    "\n[2] It\u2019s notable that these howling tantrums from the German bishops halted abruptly about the same time as Cardinal Kasper gave his infamous consistory speech in February 2014."

    "\nBishop Thomas Tobin of Providence RI, - nicknamed the \u201cGood Tobin\u201d in contrast to the \u201cBad Tobin\u201d and FrancisCardinal, Joseph Tobin of Newark \u2013 got quite an earful when he tweeted the other day, \u201cDespite the egregious offenses of a few, and despite the faults and sins we all have, I\u2019m very proud of my brother bishops and I admire and applaud the great work they do everyday for Christ and His Church.\u201d\nThe replies haven\u2019t topped out yet, at 121, nearly all of them expressing outrage at this cavalier attitude toward the revelation that Cardinal McCarrick has been proven to be a life-long homosexual rapist and sexual predator, grooming and trapping young men and children into unwanted sexual contact; and that nearly the entire episcopate of the United States either colluded directly or kept quiet about it.",
    "\nIt\u2019s clear that even the \u201cgood bishops\u201d have simply no idea how close they are to being bodily chucked out of their own churches by furious mobs.",
    "\nAs I wrote elsewhere, since 2002, most Catholics know perfectly well, despite the lame whitewashing attempt, that \u201cthe US bishops gave themselves a pass\u201d on clerical sex abuse with the Dallas Charter \u201ca thing that brazenly shifted blame.\u201d And it seems that though they\u2019re still doing this, quite a few lay Catholics just aren\u2019t having it.",
    "\nWe are seeing the final slide, the expected and inevitable result of the last 100 years.",
    "\nThe Church was infiltrated, we know this, in the 19th century by some pretty dark forces, and they have finally come into the ascendancy and are showing themselves quite clearly for what they are.",
    "\nThe McCarrick news \u2013 and all the stuff swirling around it like the latest about Bishop Pineda and his connection to Pope Francis through Cardinal Maradiaga \u2013 has not come in contrast to this but as an intrinsic part of it.",
    "\nThe scandal of McCarrick is simply a toxic emission, a venting of the gasses that build up naturally around any rotting thing.",
    "\nRod Dreher[1] is doing excellent work compiling testimony from priests and others saying out loud at last what many of us had known for many years about McCarrick and his gang.",
    "\nIt has shown the world what Traditionalists have known, that it is emphatically NOT the result of one \u201cbad apple\u201d or even only a \u201cfew\u201d as the hapless \u201cconservative\u201d Bishop Tobin tried to claim on Twitter.",
    "\nThis is the result of a mass-collusion.",
    "\nAs our friend Steve Skojec put it the other day, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to stop pretending it\u2019s just the progressive element in the Church.",
    "\nThe \u2018conservatives\u2019 are complicit, too.\u201d In short, as it was during his days of glory, globe trotting on the dime of the State Department, hosting presidents for dinner and inviting John Paul II and Mother Theresa to tea, so it is now: McCarrick is the face of the New Paradigm.",
    "\nWhether he now has to go live in obscurity in some beach house in the Caymans, it will remain true: McCarrick is the \u201cNew Church.\u201d\nA point that Dreher\u2019s informants have brought up needs to be made emphatic: the homosexualist cabal that is currently reported to be dominant in the Catholic hierarchy (and don\u2019t imagine this is confined to the United States or even to the English speaking world) have a well documented methodology of mutual protection-and-threat that keeps the whole apparatus afloat.",
    "\nIn briefest and simplest possible terms, immoral or even illegal sexual activity is preferred because it leaves a man open to blackmail, to control through fear of exposure[2].",
    "\nWhen that blackmailing culture becomes ascendant, it will always reject the morally upright as too dangerous, too difficult to control.",
    "\nThis is why faithful seminarians are rejected and why faithful priests are harassed.",
    "\nAs Dreher reported,\nWhen predatory gay priests run seminaries, they select on a bias for gay candidates...",
    "\nGay seminarians who intend to be celibate, Sipe said, face tremendous pressure to have sex.",
    "\nIf they slip up even once, their failure will be noted, and shared\u2026 And they will be made to understand that their lapse is remembered.",
    "\nLater, as a priest, predators within the priesthood have that knowledge to hold over the heads of other gay priests, to keep them silent if they ever have the desire to blow whistles.",
    "\nWhen I was covering the scandal in the early 2000s, I spoke to several, unconnected heterosexual men \u2014 priests, former priests, seminarians \u2014 who said that gay seminary rectors or diocesan officials encouraged them to take female sexual partners, so that they too would be complicit in sexual secret-keeping, and therefore no longer [be] a potential danger.",
    "\nNothing in a system like that is a greater threat to the corrupt than men who are not corrupt.",
    "\nFor many priests, one might say all good priests, this is not a sustainable situation, to say the least.",
    "\nI\u2019ve had quite a few conversations with priests who are now asking how to deal with it.",
    "\nHow are they to continue to offer the sacraments in this situation?",
    "\nWhere are they to live?",
    "\nHow are they to maintain themselves?",
    "\nThese are the priests who did make it through this institutional gauntlet, who remain faithful now but are still under the control of these often grossly corrupt and evil men.",
    "\nAs men known to be incorruptible themselves, there is a big target painted on their backs.",
    "\nIn short, not only can a bad bishop harry a man out of his ministry, he has complete control over the priest\u2019s material life.",
    "\nThe bishop can, with the flick of a pen or a single phone call, render a priest homeless, penniless and jobless.",
    "\nAnd these, remember, are men, often well on in years, whose only education and employment training has likely been academic degrees in philosophy and theology, and whose only professional contacts are ecclesiastical.",
    "\nMoreover, because of the globalisation of the bishop-network, a man blackballed for his authentic Catholicity will be a pariah in every diocese in the world.",
    "\nAnd with the advent of Bergoglio in Rome, there are no more havens; as many of the former Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate have learned, the blackballing has gone global with this pontificate.",
    "\nHe will remain a pariah even among the so-called \u201cgood\u201d bishops who live in terror of the immense power of the cabal\u2026 (see above re: McCarrick & President Bush/John Paul II.)",
    "\nI have been hearing from priests who are saying in effect, \u201cWe\u2019re trapped in this situation and forced to remain silent because if we don\u2019t we\u2019ll not only be unable to function as priests, but we\u2019ll be homeless and penniless.",
    "\nWe\u2019re unemployable in any other field.\u201d And as much as we might be tempted to say, \u201cWell suck it up, this is for the good of souls,\u201d the reality is that these are not small considerations.",
    "\nMany priests are getting older \u2013 many of them with health issues \u2013 and a man who has already given 20 or 30 years of his life to the Church is faced with a practical impossibility if he finds himself blacklisted.",
    "\nOf course there are some who don\u2019t fit this mould; there are a lot of second careers in the priesthood and plenty of people go into seminary after some years in the normal workforce and can go back to it at need.",
    "\nSome of the men now coming forward with complaints against McCarrick, who left the priesthood over their experiences, have gone on to have normal, healthy working lives.",
    "\nBut I think honestly most priests are in this corner and they know it and so do their bishops.",
    "\nI think a young man goes forward in great faith, spends ten to fifteen years studying philosophy and theology - fields that have almost no application in the workforce outside academia or the Church - with the honest, and frankly fair, expectation of a lifetime of employment and a safety net at the end.",
    "\nAs one of them said to me, \u201cThe old arrangement was, \u2018Remain faithful, do the work, and we will look after you.",
    "\nWe\u2019ll house, feed and clothe you and look after your retirement.\u2019 The new arrangement is a perversion of that: \u2018Keep quiet and go along with it all and you\u2019ll be fine, but step an inch out of line and we\u2019ll destroy you.\u2019\u201d\nSo what do we do?",
    "\nThe Old Paradigm is destroyed and going along with the New Paradigm is a guarantee of destruction for yourself and everyone else.",
    "\nAs we saw in Ireland this week, the Purge has started.",
    "\nIt\u2019s not enough to simply demand that a priest continue in his ministry no matter what.",
    "\nWe need to start working together with faithful priests \u2013 while there still are some \u2013 to help them create practical material alternatives.",
    "\nIf we who still love the Church want priests to be faithful, and even to start denouncing the evil and corruption they see, we are going to have to help them create a modicum of independence and security in which to do it.",
    "\nThe other day the American conservative writer, John Zmirak, wrote a sound suggestion on Twitter that I think it\u2019s time we all started taking seriously.",
    "\nIn response to the continued outrages of both \u201cgood\u201d and bad bishops, Zmirak suggested establishing \u201can escrow fund in each scandal-plagued diocese, where laymen [can] deposit the funds they would have donated to [the] local church, until [a] new bishop [is] appointed.\u201d\nI responded: \u201cAnd the money could be used to purchase properties to house faithful priests punished by their bishops for refusing the New Paradigm.",
    "\nWe could even perhaps buy a few convents so contemplative nuns could continue to pray in peace, without harassment from the evil men in Rome.\u201d\nI am hearing lately from laymen who are starting to talk about setting up financial structures to ensure that the authentic Catholic life can be maintained through what is obviously soon to be a general collapse of the institution.",
    "\nThis would mean independent non-profit foundations that could build or buy church buildings, convents and even schools and provide salaries for priests and other staff.",
    "\nI started thinking about this recently when I received a note from a reader with a link to an online petition from Germany, addressed to the German bishops [!!!]",
    "\n\u201cbegging\u201d those manifestly evil and apostate men not to close a famous and ancient monastic house.",
    "\nI responded that this was going about things the wrong way.",
    "\nCatholics are going to have to get their heads out of the mindset that they are helpless petitioners, \u201cbegging\u201d the hierarchy to maintain the Faith.",
    "\nFirst of all, it only gives them a frisson of pleasure to see us groveling and begging for mercy.",
    "\nLet\u2019s not give them that, OK?",
    "\nThere\u2019s already enough \u201cfrissons of pleasure\u201d in their lives.",
    "\nSecond, it\u2019s simply not going to work.",
    "\nIn Germany, in the US, in Canada, in Italy, in Britain\u2026 throughout the Church in the 1st world, and in much of it elsewhere, the men in charge of the \u201cinstitutional Church\u201d \u2013 that is, whose names are on the bank accounts \u2013 are dedicated to the destruction of everything we want to preserve.",
    "\nThe wolves are now looking with ravening eyes at the faithful.",
    "\nThey are, in short, our enemies.",
    "\nThey\u2019ve become so by making themselves the enemies of Christ and His Holy Church.",
    "\nThey know it and it\u2019s time we stopped imagining otherwise.",
    "\nThe other suggestion I have is for young men interested in the priesthood to fortify themselves not only spiritually but in the material sphere.",
    "\nThere\u2019s one big vulnerability we can guard against pretty easily.",
    "\nNo one should be facing penury and permanent unemployment because he\u2019s a faithful Catholic.",
    "\nWe should never be letting any young man go into any diocesan seminary without being a property owner.",
    "\nHe should own a house or stand to inherit one.",
    "\nFamilies have to come to see this as a duty to the child and to the Church.",
    "\nAnd more than that, the potential priest needs to have job skills that have nothing to do with the priesthood.",
    "\nAmong the working classes there is a bias against intellectual work.",
    "\nBut most working class people have a pretty sensible attitude towards ambitions in academia: get something under your belt you can fall back on.",
    "\nHow many philosophy PhDs can build himself a bookshelf?",
    "\nChange the oil in a car?",
    "\nRewire a house?",
    "\nThe standard clich\u00e9 of young people with useless academic degrees working at Starbucks has become so common it\u2019s not even worth memeing anymore.",
    "\nHow many young men do we foresee being forced out of seminary for having the wrong \u201csexual orientation\u201d?",
    "\nEvery one of those guys needs to be able to snap his fingers in the face of the rector and walk straight into a decent job, based not on any recommendation from a corrupt bishop, but on his solid skills.",
    "\nAmong the white collar classes there is a bias against blue collar work, but the trades are crying out for skilled men and a trade school diploma in fixing tractors is a lot cheaper and a lot faster to get than a university degree.",
    "\nThat\u2019s an economic asset that we can\u2019t afford to turn up our well-educated noses at.",
    "\nDon't miss Hilary White's next article in the July 31 Print Edition of The Remnant Newspaper; Subscribe today!",
    "\n\n\nIt reminds me of a discussion I had some years ago with the prior of a Benedictine monastery that is attracting a lot of young vocations.",
    "\nOne kid wanted to join and told me they had recommended he go to some college or other to study philosophy first.",
    "\nThis college, apparently, waives much of the tuition and gives work studies to people going for the priesthood and religious life so they can avoid the student loan trap.",
    "\nThis is fine, good idea.",
    "\nBut I asked him what he knew how to do.",
    "\n\u201cCan you fix a bathroom pipe?",
    "\nDo you know anything about what to feed a sheep or how to care for a cow?",
    "\nCan you drive a tractor?\u201d This nice kid, who certainly does have a vocation, could read books and look things up on the internet and write a pretty mean paper on Thomas Aquinas, but not a lot else.",
    "\nThere is going to have to be a shift in attitude in our remaining faithful institutions.",
    "\nDoes a monastery really need all of its members to have PhDs in philosophy and theology?",
    "\nWouldn\u2019t it also be useful to have an electrician, a plumber, a carpenter, a cook, someone who knows how to fix a car or a tractor?",
    "\nOr for that matter, a certified accountant or an investment banker?",
    "\nIf you insist on having people with degrees, maybe a degree in agriculture would be a good fit for a big monastic foundation with a lot of land like, say, Clear Creek or that new Carmelite place in Nebraska.",
    "\nI think this is the time we are going to have to start overcoming our class snobbery.",
    "\nYoung men with ambitions for the priesthood are going to have to tuck away employability and an independent financial foundation, in the same way people used to tuck money away against a rainy day.",
    "\nSimply put, they\u2019ve got to stop being materially dependent on the hierarchy.",
    "\nThis vulnerability is a gun to their heads in this time.",
    "\nThe next kid who says anything to me about wanting to enter the diocesan priesthood, I\u2019m going to ask, \u201cHow sound is your investment portfolio?\u201d The next candidate for religious life, I\u2019ll ask, \u201cGreat!",
    "\nWhat\u2019s your trade?",
    "\nWhat do you have to fall back on?\u201d\nI\u2019m given to understand that some houses of the Congregation of the Oratory ask candidates to come with an independent income, which, given what we\u2019re seeing elsewhere doesn\u2019t sound like a bad idea.",
    "\nPerhaps Catholic financial advisors could be encouraged to set up a programme to teach young men how to create a sound financial footing with investments.",
    "\nMeanwhile, we must refocus our energy on the Faith itself, instead of the physical and even canonical structures that house it.",
    "\nThat monastery in Germany is lost.",
    "\nThose bishops want the property and they\u2019ll get it.",
    "\nWhat the group of laymen should be doing, instead of petitioning that it be saved, is finding a place where the nuns can live their charism of religious life without episcopal harassment.",
    "\nBishops won\u2019t protect and support good priests?",
    "\nThen it\u2019s up to us.",
    "\nThe Vatican wants to force all religious congregations into the pants-wearing, Marxist anti-nun, LCWR pattern?",
    "\nWe\u2019re not helpless.",
    "\nWe start buying convent buildings and start a fund to support the nun-refugees.",
    "\nOur goal must be preserving the precious treasure, the Deposit of the Faith, the sacramental life, the great charisms and artifacts of the religious life.",
    "\nI am reminded of what the curators of the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg did in the face of the advancing German army.",
    "\nThey took down, packed up and hid the art treasures, some of the greatest in the world.",
    "\nOver a million precious works of art were sent on trains to be hidden in the Urals.",
    "\nTwo trains got away to safety, but one was still there when the Germans surrounded the city and began the siege.",
    "\nThe museum\u2019s website tells us:\n\u201cDespite starvation and severely cold temperatures, the Museum continued its preservational functions.",
    "\nWith only a skeleton staff left behind, it was difficult to protect the vast buildings and their sumptuous interiors against snow, wind and rain.",
    "\nEquipped with first-aid kits, wearing helmets and gloves, the Museum air wardens cleared away heaps of broken bricks and the remains of charred flooring after each bomb hit the building; they helped dig out the living and the dead and bandage the wounded after raids in the surrounding area.",
    "\nTwelve air-raid shelters were fitted out in the basements of the Museum complex and until the first evacuations were made in March 1942 there were 12,000 people housed there permanently, among them the Museum Director, celebrated Academician Iosif Orbeli.\u201d \u201cHermitage staff both in Sverdlovsk and in Leningrad acted as museum attendants, continuing their scholarly activity and lecturing in hospitals, holding conferences, writing scholarly articles.",
    "\nNo items were lost during the evacuation.\u201d\nTo keep up everyone\u2019s morale, the museum staff, while bombs were falling and they and their patrons were equally starving, continued to give tours and lectures, describing perfectly the artworks that had been removed.",
    "\nThey understood the value of what they had, and did everything within their power to preserve and protect it.",
    "\nDoes this all sound a bit, well, schismatic?",
    "\nNot necessarily.",
    "\nAny bishop who can demonstrate through his actions and not just with his tweets, who can prove that he is still a Catholic and not a wolf, is welcome to join us.",
    "\nBut we\u2019d be fools to wait for them.",
    "\nWhatever you might think of Archbishop Lefebvre\u2019s solution over the last few decades, it certainly seems inarguable that the \u201cstate of emergency\u201d for which he was preparing has come at last.",
    "\nAnd in a state of emergency, certain norms are naturally suspended.",
    "\nThe simple fact is that soon there are going to be \u201cvagus\u201d priests who have been thrown out of their ministry for maintaining the Faith.",
    "\nThere are going to be nuns and monks without homes, as in the England of Henry VIII.",
    "\nI think it\u2019s only reasonable that those who also want to maintain the Faith should reach out to them and offer what shelter we can.",
    "\nWhat we have seen this week is making it clear that we can simply no longer sit back and \u201cbeg\u201d bishops to maintain and defend the Faith.",
    "\nIt\u2019s not enough now to go into seminary or a monastery with glowing eyes and a firm faith.",
    "\nSentiment isn\u2019t going to be much comfort when the young man is no longer so very young and finds himself standing on the street outside the chancery with no skills, no money, no job, (no health insurance) and no prospects.",
    "\nIf it is true that we really are alone in this, then so be it.",
    "\nLet\u2019s stop lamenting and start doing practical things about it.",
    "\n___________________________________\n[1] Dreher and others are asking some very important questions now about the activities of the men McCarrick is known to have mentored, one of whom is currently making interesting headlines as Pope Francis\u2019 Cardinal Prefect of the new Dicastery for Laity, Family and Life, and as the primary organiser of the upcoming World Meeting of Families in his native Dublin.",
    "\nIt should probably be noted that up to the time he left over a \u201cdifference of opinion\u201d with the group\u2019s leadership, Cardinal Kevin Farrell as also deeply involved in the Legionaries of Christ.",
    "\nHe joined in 1966, was ordained in \u201978, and was quickly appointed to a high-ranking position as general director with responsibility for seminaries and schools of the Legionaries of Christ in Italy, Spain and Ireland until 1983.",
    "\nThis period was at the peak of the power of the grotesquely corrupt Fr.",
    "\nMaciel, for whom it has been shown ALL the Legion\u2019s leadership was covering.",
    "\nThe Farrell family\u2019s involvement in the Legion continues with his brother, Bishop Brian Farrell, who ordained 20 new priests to the questionable-but-officially-reformed community in 2015.",

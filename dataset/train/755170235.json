    "\nThe plan, authored by the Security Studies Group, or SSG, a national security think-tank that has close ties to senior White House national security officials, including \u2013 who else \u2013 National Security Adviser John Bolton, seeks to reshape longstanding American foreign policy toward Iran by emphasizing an explicit policy of regime change, something the Obama administration opposed when popular protests gripped Iran in 2009, writes the Free Beacon, which obtained a leaked copy of the circulating plans.",
    "\nThe regime change plan seeks to fundamentally shift U.S. policy towards Iran and has found a receptive audience in the Trump administration, which has been moving in this direction since Bolton\u2014a longtime and vocal supporter of regime change\u2014entered the White House.",

    "Evidence shows Pope Francis is a \u2018principal in a cover-up\u2019 of clergy sex-abuse in Chile: Expert\n\nNewsCatholic Church\nWASHINGTON, D.C., February 12, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) \u2013 Those familiar with Jorge Bergoglio in Argentina before he became Pope Francis say it is a \u201cclassic\u201d move of his to provide \u201cmercy\u201d to clergy who are sexual predators while asking everybody else to simply \u201cmove on,\u201d said attorney and child advocate Elizabeth Yore on an EWTN show last week.",

    "\n\u201cThere are many people who know the Pope from Argentina who have said this is classic Bergoglio to provide mercy to the predators and ask everybody else to move on,\u201d she added.",
    "\n(See original The World Over program segment on this issue that begins at 47 seconds into the video below)\nYore, who has handled child abuse investigations and clergy abuse investigations throughout her legal career, was commenting on the latest sexual abuse case to touch the Francis papacy, in this case where the Pope appointed a bishop with a history of complicity in child sex abuse.",
    "\nThe Pope\u2019s claim that he had never received any victim testimony regarding the complicity of Chilean Bishop Juan Barros in child sex abuse has proven to be false.",
    "\n\u201cThe Barros case is putting the Pope, for the first time, in the middle as a principal in a cover-up,\u201d Yore said during the interview.",
    "\nYore said that not only is it now known that the Pope received a letter from one of the victims, but it is also now known that he was \u201ctold from the moment he appointed Bishop Barros in 2015 that this was a bad decision.\u201d\n\u201cThe Chilean Archbishop conference told him to revoke this appointment.",

    "\nYore called the child sex abuse case involving infamous Chilean priest abuser Father Fernando Karadima and Bishop Juan Barros \u201ca scandal of epic proportions.\u201d\nThe scandal signals that the Church under Francis is slipping backwards in its handling of abuse, said Yore.",
    "\nYore called the example Pope Francis set in the way he handled the abuse information \u201cextremely dangerous.\u201d\n\u201cBut it is extremely dangerous as the head of the Catholic Church \u2014 you know, the last appeal \u2014 that this is the kind of behavior that is going to be mimicked around the world by bishops, [who will say] \u2018Well if the Pope is not going to intervene and impose zero tolerance, why should I?\u2019\u201d\nReports say Pope Francis personally received the eight-page letter from the Chilean victim graphically detailing the alleged abuses by Karadima and linking Barros as having witnessed and covered up the abuse.",
    "\nThe alleged abuse took place decades prior to Francis\u2019s 2015 appointment of Barros to the Diocese of Osorno in southern Chile.",
    "\nPope Francis received the victim\u2019s letter in 2015, its author and a member of Francis\u2019s sex abuse commission have said, contradicting the Pope\u2019s recent insistence that no victims had come forward in the matter and no evidence had been produced.",
    "\nFrancis encountered protests in Chile over his defense of Barros during his visit there last month, calling the accusations against the priest \u201ccalumny.\u201d\nWhile Francis later apologized, he persisted in defending Barros, denying that he had received any testimony himself and restating that such unproven accusations are \u201cslander.\u201d\nThe Pope later said he would send Malta Archbishop Charles Scicluna \u2013 the former top Vatican abuse investigator - to Chile to investigate the matter.",

    "\nFour members of the commission had met with Cardinal O\u2019Malley in 2015, conveying their objections to Francis\u2019s 2015 appointment of Barros as bishop of Osorno.",
    "\nIt was at the meeting with O\u2019Malley that the abuse commission representatives reportedly gave the letter to the cardinal to deliver to Francis, and O\u2019Malley later confirmed to a commission member that he had in fact personally delivered the letter to the Pope.",
    "\nYore explained that the Pope has been told from the moment he appointed Barros in 2015 that it was a bad decision, between the Chilean bishops\u2019 conference, petitions, letters and calls, that were all ignored.",
    "\nFurther, a Chilean judicial inquiry found all the victims who testified \u2014 including the letter\u2019s author Juan Carlos \u2014 to be credible, and that there was a major cover-up of the abuse by Father Karadima.",
    "\nArroyo spoke with Cruz as well, who said he was \u201cincredibly frustrated\u201d when Barros was going to be appointed.",
    "\nHe\u2019d testified about three bishops who had witnessed abuse, he said, but Barros had special significance for him because Barros\u2019 part went beyond witnessing the abuse, to violating his seal of Confession with Karadima and psychological abuse through intimidation.",
    "\nCruz recounted how he and other victims had been dismissed or slandered by local Church hierarchy for numerous attempts to be heard.",
    "\nAnd he spoke about holding out hope that there would be a different response from the Pope, discussing specifics of getting the letter to the Francis via Cardinal O\u2019Malley.",
    "\nCruz told Arroyo he was really hurt and felt betrayed by the Pope\u2019s comments that the accusations were slander, and there were no witnesses or evidence.",
    "\n\u201cTo hear him talk about us that way,\u201d Cruz said, \u201ccalling us slanderers, it was terrible because it set the clock back for so many victims.\u201d\nScicluna will be meeting with Cruz, who said he hopes other abuse survivors will be heard as a result of his case coming more to the forefront.",
    "\n\u201cThis leaves us with very strong evidence that the Pope was, in fact, aware of what has happened,\u201d Yore said.",
    "\n\u201cHere we have victims 10, 15 years after their abuse, begging the Pope, having to take pictures of a letter that\u2019s handed to a cardinal to ensure that there is evidence that the Pope is receiving this information.\u201d\nThe whole of Latin America, including Argentina, was well aware of what was happening when this case broke in Chile in 2010, Yore noted, and yet the Pope continues to shrug his shoulders and say he has no information.",
    "\nThis was precisely what he\u2019d been saying when he was cardinal and archbishop in Buenos Aires, she said, that no one ever came forward with information, and there were never any cases of clerical abuse in the entirety of the two-million-plus member Archdiocese of Buenos Aires.",
    "\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just simply a cover-up of a predator priest,\u201d Yore stated.",
    "\n\u201cThis is Barros present, in the room when the abuse is ongoing with these young minor boys.\u201d\nShe said she would argue as a child advocate that Barros was involved in sexual exploitation of children.",
    "\n\u201cSo I don\u2019t think this is simply just a case, as bad as it is, of a cover-up of an abuser,\u201d she said.",
    "\n\u201cThis is also sexual exploitation of children in a grooming gang, a predator priest.",
    "\nThis is why it is so heinous.\u201d\nYore said that given the Church\u2019s sex abuse crisis, one would have thought going into the 2013 conclave (which elected Francis) that an obvious priority in vetting candidates for the papacy would have meant a serious look at their history of handling abuse allegations in their previous sees.",
    "\nThere are more cases out there just like Barros that have been covered up, Yore told Arroyo, maybe even some even worse than the Barros case.",
    "\n\u201cThose cases are going to be haunting this papacy and really causing a rift in the major protection of children that Pope Benedict had worked very hard to really build up,\u201d she said.",
    "\n\u201cTrust within the faithful and to put in a system that was going to root out the predators.",
    "\nAnd I think that has just been blown up and I think we are back to square one in the Vatican.\""

    "\nFord did well enough that during the break between her testimony and Kavanaugh\u2019s, commentators on Fox News such as Brit Hume and Andrew Napolitano were openly musing about the nominee withdrawing, opinions that were sharply reversed after the nominee completed his testimony hours later.",

    "\nShe could do little else.",
    "\nShe had many restrictions placed upon her and was only allowed to question Ford for minutes at a time before surrendering the floor to the next committee Democrat.",
    "\nAs commentator Sean Davis tweeted:\n\u201cHard to do much else when the witness conveniently has no corroborating evidence, no memory of any verifiable facts of what happened, and everyone she says was present at the alleged incident--even her best friend--has denied it.\u201d\nNonetheless, Mitchell\u2019s questioning came across at times as perfunctory, leading many observers to conclude that Republicans threw away a valuable opportunity by using her as a stand-in.",
    "\nShe failed to lay a glove on a witness whose implausible, internally contradictory story cried out for vigorous cross-examination.",
    "\nIn the end the too-deferential, easygoing Mitchell failed to provide much, if anything, in the way of evidence against Ford or in favor of Kavanaugh.",
    "\nWhether her work will bring over fence-sitting senators to Kavanaugh\u2019s side remains to be seen.",
    "\nLike other Democrats, Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii tried to help Ford, lobbing her softballs.",
    "\nAfter saying she thought she knew what Mitchell was trying to get at in her questions, the senator said, \u201cso I'll just ask you very plainly, Dr. Ford, is there a political motivation for your coming forward with your account of the assault by Brett Kavanaugh?\u201d\n\u201cNo, and I'd like to reiterate that again, I was trying to get the information to you while there was still a list of other what looked like equally-qualified candidates,\u201d Ford replied.",
    "\nWhen Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) asked Ford \u201cwith what degree of certainty do you believe Brett Kavanaugh assaulted you?\u201d Ford replied, \u201cone hundred percent.\u201d\nStrangely, Ford has a bad long-term memory and a bad short-term memory.",
    "\nShe doesn\u2019t know when or where the alleged incident took place, yet she is \u201cone hundred percent\u201d certain it was Kavanaugh who attacked her.",
    "\nAt the outset of the hearing, Grassley provided an overview of what Kavanaugh had gone through \u2013including the Democrats\u2019 sordid behavior\u2014 since President Trump announced the judge\u2019s nomination on July 9.",
    "\nAs part of the confirmation process, Kavanaugh endured his sixth background investigation since 1993.",
    "\n\u201cNowhere in any of these six FBI reports, which committee investigators have reviewed on a bipartisan basis, was there a whiff of any issue \u2013 any issue at all related in any way to inappropriate sexual behavior,\u201d Grassley said.",
    "\nFord shared her allegations in a letter to the committee\u2019s ranking member, Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), in the summer.",
    "\nThe letter remained secret from July 30 through until September 13 when he first learned about it, the chairman said.",
    "\nInstead of sharing the letter with the committee, Feinstein did nothing.",
    "\nBefore the hearing, Kavanaugh met privately with 65 senators, including Feinstein, who didn\u2019t ask him about the allegations when she met with him in August.",
    "\nThe committee held a four-day public hearing from September 4 to September 7 during which Kavanaugh testified for more than 32 hours in public.",
    "\nFeinstein didn\u2019t attend it, Grassley said.",
    "\nKavanaugh answered almost 1,300 written questions senators submitted after the hearing.",
    "\nThat is \u201cmore than all prior Supreme Court nominees,\u201d he said.",
    "\n\u201cThroughout this period, we did not know about the ranking member's secret evidence.",
    "\nThen, only at an 11th hour, on the eve of Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation vote, did the ranking member refer the allegations to the FBI.",
    "\nAnd then, sadly, the allegations were leaked to the press.\u201d\n\u201cEvery step of the way the Democratic side refused to participate in what should have been a bipartisan investigation,\u201d Grassley said.",
    "\nAfter Ford\u2019s identity became public, Grassley\u2019s staff \u201ccontacted all the individuals she said attended the 1982 party described in the Washington Post article,\u201d he said.",
    "\nKavanaugh \u201cimmediately submitted to an interview under penalty of felony for any knowingly false statements.",
    "\nHe denied the allegations categorically.\u201d\n\u201cDemocratic staff was invited to participate and could have asked any questions they wanted to, but they declined.",
    "\nWhich leads me then to wonder: If they're really concerned with going to the truth, why wouldn't you want to talk to the accused?\u201d\nGrassley said his staff contacted the other individuals who allegedly attended the party at which the conduct Ford complained of allegedly took place: Mark Judge, Patrick Smyth, and Leland Keyser.",
    "\n\u201cAll three submitted statements to the Senate under \u2013 under penalty of felony, denying any knowledge of the events described by Dr. Ford.",
    "\nDr. Ford's lifelong friend, Dr. \u2013 Miss Keyser, stated she doesn't know Judge Kavanaugh and doesn't recall ever attending a party with him.\u201d\nGrassley said his staff repeatedly sought to interview Ford over the past 11 days, \u201ceven volunteering to fly to California to take her testimony, but her attorneys refused to prevent \u2013 present her allegations to Congress.\u201d\n\u201cConsistent with their stated desires to obstruct Kavanaugh's nomination\u201d by any means possible, \u201cpushed for FBI investigations into the allegations.\u201d\n\u201cWe've been trying to investigate other allegations,\u201d Grassley said.",
    "\n\u201cAt this time, we have not had cooperation from attorneys representing other clients, and they have made no attempt to substantiate their claims.\u201d\nAttorneys for new Kavanaugh accusers Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick have been approached by committee staff on eight and six occasions, respectively, Grassley said.",
    "\n\u201cNeither attorney has made their clients available for interview.",
    "\nThe committee can't do an investigation if attorneys are stonewalling.\u201d\nWith his performance at the hearing, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who is frequently a target of conservatives for going rogue on important issues, partly redeemed himself in the eyes of many conservatives.",
    "\nWhile questioning Kavanaugh, Graham lambasted the confirmation process the judge has been put through, calling it \u201cthe most unethical sham since I've been in politics.\u201d\nLashing out at Democrats, Graham said, \u201cIf you wanted an FBI investigation, you could have come to us.",
    "\nWhat you want to do is destroy this guy's life, hold this seat open and hope you win in 2020.\u201d\n\u201cBoy, you all want power,\u201d he shouted.",
    "\n\u201cGod, I hope you never get it.",
    "\nI hope the American people can see through this sham.\u201d\nGraham warned fellow GOPers about voting against the nomination.",
    "\n\u201cTo my Republican colleagues, if you vote no, you're legitimizing the most despicable thing I have seen in my time in politics.",
    "\nYou want this seat?",
    "\nI hope you never get it.\u201d\nSen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) attacked Democrats, blaming them for the \u201ccircus atmosphere that has been created\u201d since they first Ford's allegations to the media \u201ctwo weeks ago, after sitting on them for six weeks.\u201d This \u201chas brought us the worst in our politics.\u201d\n\u201cIt certainly has brought us no closer to the truth,\u201d Hatch added.",
    "\n\u201cAnonymous letters with no name and no return address are now being treated as national news.\u201d Taking a shot at Stormy Daniels attorney Michael Avenatti, Hatch said \u201cporn star lawyers with facially implausible claims are driving the news cycle.\u201d\n\u201cI hate to say this, but this is worse than Robert Bork, and I didn't think it could get any worse than that.",
    "\nThis is worse than Clarence Thomas.",
    "\nI didn't think it could get any worse than that.",
    "\nThis is a national disgrace, the way you're being treated.\u201d\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on the nomination today at 9:30 a.m.",
    "\nAsked last night about the nomination moving to the floor of the Senate for a final vote, Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) reportedly answered, \"Depends on what happens tomorrow.\"",
    "\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is planning a procedural vote on Saturday to formally move to the nomination, followed by a potential confirmation vote by the full Senate as soon as Tuesday, Politico reports.",
    "\nA handful of Democrat senators, including the perpetually vulnerable red-state senator, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, are reportedly considering voting to confirm Kavanaugh when the nomination goes before the full Senate.",
    "\nIf Kavanaugh isn\u2019t on the bench Monday, the Supreme Court will be shorthanded as it begins hearing cases in its new term.",
    "\nIt normally has a complement of nine justices but with Anthony Kennedy\u2019s retirement July 31, which cleared the way for Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination, there have been only eight justices.",
    "\nRoughly speaking there is a 4-to-4 liberal to conservative ideological split on the court.",
    "\nDemocrats are trying to drag the confirmation process into the next Congress where they hope to seize control from Republicans.",
    "\nElection Day is November 6.",
    "\nThe GOP currently controls the Senate, which has the final say on judicial nominations, by an uncomfortably close margin of 51 to 49.",
    "\nThe confirmation drama continues."

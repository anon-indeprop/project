    "\n\u201cWitness Said Awan Wiretapped Her, Then Bank Account She Controlled Was Drained,\u201d by Luke Rosiak, Daily Caller News Foundation, May 21, 2018 (thanks to Todd):\nAfter former Democratic IT aide Imran Awan allegedly threatened his stepmother not to talk to police, her email account was accessed in suspicious ways and a lawyer for one of Awan\u2019s brothers found out she emailed the FBI on specific dates and lashed out at her: \u201cYou\u2019re a liar, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Days after that, a bank account the stepmother controlled was almost completely drained through a payment to Imran\u2019s brother, Abid Awan, bank records show \u2014 but she said she is too afraid to press criminal charges because she claims he has threatened her.",

    "\nImran, Abid and Jamal Awan \u2014 along with Imran\u2019s wife, Hina Alvi, and a friend \u2014 worked as IT administrators for 1 out of every 5 House Democrats and could read all their emails and files until police banned them from the network in February 2017for \u201cnumerous violations of House security policies.\u201d Months later, none of the family is in jail, and the stepmother and other witnesses have said Imran and Abid have used their freedom to try to steer the outcome of the case since, including by threatening them not to cooperate with authorities, TheDCNF previously reported.",
    "\nIn April 2016, the House\u2019s Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) detected allegedly falsified purchase orders, and the Inspector General quickly expanded the scope to investigate cyber violations, finding that members of the Awan family improperly accessed congressmen\u2019s servers and the House Democratic Caucus server thousands of times.",
    "\nThough House officials suspected that equipment was being stolen, the Capitol Police did not search their homes, The Daily Caller News Foundation learned, and did not ban them from the network until nearly a year later.",

    "\nIn January 2017, in the days around his father\u2019s death, Abid removed Gilani as the beneficiary of his father\u2019s life insurance and replaced her with himself, which led to a lawsuit, TheDCNF previously reported.",
    "\nAbid\u2019s attorney, Jim Bacon, used the life insurance lawsuit to force Gilani to sit for a sworn deposition Oct. 4, 2017 in which he told her to reveal what she told the FBI about the congressional criminal probe and tried to get her to find out details from investigators.",

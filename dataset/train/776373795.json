    "\nTrump is already reportedly under investigation for potential obstruction of the Russia probe led by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III.",
    "\nThe tweet early Wednesday was the president\u2019s most explicit post or statement to date seemingly aimed at getting his attorney general, the nation\u2019s top law enforcement officer, to end the probe\nThe tweet, along with several others Wednesday morning, accelerated the president\u2019s attacks on the investigation, which he claims is tainted by bias.",

    "\n\u201cWhere is the Russian Collusion?\u201d Trump added.",
    "\nTrump\u2019s tweets prompted Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, to accuse the president of obstruction \u201chiding in plain sight.\u201d\n\u201cThe President of the United States just called on his Attorney General to put an end to an investigation in which the President, his family and campaign may be implicated,\u201d Schiff tweeted.",

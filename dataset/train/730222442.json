    "\n\"The tumbling actually causes stresses and strains internal to the object, and that slowly but surely squeezes and pulls on the object just like tides on the Earth to remove energy from the spin,\" Fraser said.",
    "\nBut, at least for the next few billion years, the space invader is destined to continue its topsy-turvy spin."

    "Pope Francis' sexual abuse commission, hit by resignations and criticism, gets a reboot\n\nLast week Pope Francis announced he was reviving a panel he created to advise the Vatican on how to handle sexual abuse by clergy.",
    "\nThe issue has dogged the Roman Catholic Church in recent years, and critics have accused Francis and his two predecessors, John Paul II and Benedict XVI, of failing to aggressively weed out and punish predator priests.",
    "\nHere\u2019s a look what drove the panel\u2019s creation and what to expect in the future.",
    "\nWhat is Pope Francis\u2019 commission on sexual abuse?",
    "\nFollowing criticism he was not focusing on halting child abuse within the church, Francis created the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors in March 2014, naming Cardinal Sean O\u2019Malley, the archbishop of Boston, to run it.",
    "\nO\u2019Malley was not only a member of the pope\u2019s \u201cG9\u201d group of close advisors; he was also the man who sought to clean up the abuse scandal in Boston after the departure of his predecessor, Cardinal Bernard Law, whose shifting of predator priests to new posts was exposed by the Boston Globe and chronicled in the movie \u201cSpotlight.\u201d\nThe revelations about Law, who died in December, emboldened abuse victims across the country and world, who began speaking up about the priests who had molested them.",
    "\nWhen he created the commission, Francis said: \u201cThe commission\u2019s specific task is to propose to me the most opportune initiatives for protecting minors and vulnerable adults, in order that we may do everything possible to ensure that crimes such as those which have occurred are no longer repeated in the Church.\u201d\nWhy is it being renewed now?",
    "\nAfter the commission\u2019s three-year mandate expired in December, Francis relaunched it on Feb. 17 with some members reappointed and nine new members added, some of whom are victims of abuse, although the Vatican declined to say which, opting to respect their privacy.",
    "\nO\u2019Malley returns as chief.",
    "\nNew members come from Australia, Brazil, Ethiopia, India, the Netherlands and Tonga, \"reflecting the global reach of the church and the challenge of creating safeguarding structures in diverse cultural context,\u201d the Vatican said.",
    "\nWhat did the first commission achieve?",
    "\nThe Vatican has said it \u201cworked with almost 200 dioceses and religious communities worldwide to raise awareness and to educate people on the need for safeguarding in our homes, parishes, schools, hospitals, and other institutions.\u201d\nWhat didn\u2019t it do?",
    "\nCommission members quickly realized they needed to go beyond raising awareness and deal with the bishops who quietly shift offenders to new dioceses when they are exposed as molesters and rapists.",
    "\nEven if church laws already existed to hold bishops accountable for their priests\u2019 behavior, those strictures were not enough, O\u2019Malley said in 2014.",
    "\n\u201cThere are, theoretically I guess, canons that could apply here, but obviously they have not been sufficient,\u201d he said.",
    "\nThe commission was behind Francis\u2019 decision in 2015 to create a new tribunal to judge bishops caught covering up for abusive priests, and to fund it for five years.",
    "\nBut amid myriad legal questions over what exact powers the court would have, it never got off the ground.",
    "\nIn 2016, Francis officially killed the plan to create it, issuing a document that essentially called on using existing procedures to tackle the problem.",
    "\nFrancis was also criticized when Australian Cardinal George Pell, whom he had brought to Rome to clean up Vatican finances, was forced to return to Australia last year to face charges of sexual assault.",
    "\nAny other problems?",
    "\nCommission members said bishops should call the police when they discovered predator priests, rather than phone the nearest religious retreat to \u201cpark\u201d the priest out of harm\u2019s way.",
    "\nBut this simple message was hard to get across.",
    "\nIt emerged that during a Vatican training course for new bishops in September 2015 a French priest informed bishops they had no obligation to report abuse to the police, forcing the commission to issue a strong statement saying bishops had every obligation to do so.",
    "\nDid commission members persevere?",
    "\nNot all of them.",
    "\nBritish member Peter Saunders, a former victim of priestly abuse, was ousted in 2016.",
    "\nHe said the group was a toothless, paper-shuffling exercise.",
    "\nIrish member Marie Collins, another victim, resigned in March last year and said Vatican bureaucrats had refused to comply with the commission\u2019s request \u2014 approved by the pope \u2014 to respond to all letters sent to the Vatican by abuse victims.",
    "\nMarie Collins, then a member of the pope's sex abuse commission, in 2015 hands a letter to Cardinal Sean O'Malley detailing the abuse suffered by Juan Carlos Cruz of Chile.",
    "\nCatherine Bonnet / Associated Press\nWas the pope listening to the commission?",
    "\nPossibly not.",
    "\nIn 2015, Collins handed O\u2019Malley a letter addressed to the pope from Juan Carlos Cruz, a Chilean abused as a boy by Chilean prelate Fernando Karadima, who was sentenced by the Vatican to a lifetime of penance in 2010.",
    "\nCruz described how the abuse was witnessed and covered up by Juan Barros, a priest whose appointment as a bishop in 2015 prompted huge protests in Chile.",
    "\nThe pope has stuck by Barros, dismissing the protesters as \u201clefties\u201d and hugging Barros publicly during his visit to Chile last month.",
    "\n\"I can't condemn [Barros] because I don't have evidence,\" he said on the plane back to Rome, suggesting he had ignored or never read the letter from Cruz.",
    "\nThat was too much for O\u2019Malley, who said Francis had caused \"great pain\u201d to victims.",
    "\nIf Francis was not listening to the commission about Barros, whom was he listening to?",
    "\nVatican watchers believe the pope was influenced by Chilean Cardinal Francisco Javier Errazuriz, a member of the G9 group who has backed Barros and reportedly helped block moves to make Cruz a member of the abuse commission.",
    "\nSo is the pope intransigent on Barros?",
    "\nNo.",
    "\nSomething changed his mind after his Chilean trip, possibly the scale of the protest against Barros in the country.",
    "\nOn Feb. 17, he sent a senior Vatican sex abuse investigator, Archbishop Charles Scicluna, to New York to interview Cruz, who now lives in Philadelphia.",
    "\n\"For the first time I felt that someone is listening,\" Cruz said after the meeting.",
    "\nWhat happens next?",
    "\n\u201cThis should lead to Barros stepping down,\u201d said Saunders, who is forming his own campaign group with Cruz and others to fight clerical abuse.",

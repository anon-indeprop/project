Julian Assange Best Price: $3.04 Buy New $9.55 (as of 06:45 EDT - Details)\nIn a letter to the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, Julian\u2019s father, John Shipton, wrote: \u201cI ask the prime minister to do all within his power to return Julian home before Julian\u2019s situation becomes an irreversible tragedy.\u201d That is why this is such an urgent case of justice toward a single human being as well as a case of a journalistic organization\u2019s right to function and our right to have the information it provides.",

    "\nThe judge\u2019s husband is a figure deep within the national security establishment in Britain who was named in WikiLeaks documents.",

    "\nThe attacks on Julian Assange illustrate what has happened to the so-called free media in the West.",

    "\nWikiLeaks has in fact shamed journalists, which might help to explain the deeply personal abuse he has suffered.",
    "\nWikiLeaks has revealed what journalists should have revealed a long time ago.",
    "\nDB: Even the attorney for the New York Times happened to mention that if Julian Assange gets prosecuted, the Times could get prosecuted under the same laws.",
    "\nJP: It could but I don\u2019t believe it would be, because power respects power.",

    "\nThe difference with WikiLeaks is that it is outside of the establishment and is truly independent.",
    "\nDB: What would be your strongest plea for Julian Assange?",
    "\nJP: It\u2019s very simple.",
    "\nThis is about justice.",
    "\nIn a famous speech given in the 1930\u2019s by Parson Martin Niemoller, he said that first the Nazis came for socialists, but he didn\u2019t speak up because that didn\u2019t concern him.",
    "\nThen they came for trade unionists, but he didn\u2019t speak up because that didn\u2019t concern him.",
    "\nHe didn\u2019t speak up when they came for the Jews because he wasn\u2019t a Jew.",
    "\nAnd, of course, finally they came for him.",
    "\nThat might not be a precise parallel, but if Julian Assange is allowed to literally go under, it represents the conquest of all of us.",
    "\nIt means that we have kept quiet.",
    "\nKeeping quiet has allowed the great atrocities of histories to take place.",
    "\nIf Julian is allowed to be spirited away to some super-max hellhole, it will be a great atrocity.",
    "\nDB: In the library, silence is golden.",
    "\nIn the world of human rights, silence equals mass murder.",
    "\nThey say you shouldn\u2019t yell fire in a crowded theater just to get a reaction.",
    "\nBut if you know the theater is in fact on fire and you do not shout out, what happens after is your responsibility.",

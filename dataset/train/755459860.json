    "\nThe three-page white paper being circulated among National Security Council officials in the White House offers a strategy by which the Trump administration can actively work to assist an already aggravated Iranian public topple the hardline ruling regime through a democratization strategy that focuses on driving a deeper wedge between the Iranian people and the ruling regime.",
    "\nThe plan, authored by the Security Studies Group, or SSG, a national security think-tank that has close ties to senior White House national security officials, including National Security Adviser John Bolton, seeks to reshape longstanding American foreign policy toward Iran by emphasizing an explicit policy of regime change, something the Obama administration opposed when popular protests gripped Iran in 2009.",
    "\nThe regime change plan seeks to fundamentally shift U.S. policy towards Iran and has found a receptive audience in the Trump administration, which has been moving in this direction since Bolton\u2014a longtime and vocal supporter of regime change\u2014entered the White House.",

    "\nPresident Trump hired him knowing all of that.",
    "\nThe administration will now start aggressively moving to deal with the root cause of chaos and violence in the region in a clear-eyed way.\u201d\nBolton says it will be accomplished in the next six months.",
    "\nI don't doubt it.",
    "\nThis will probably end up being another Ukraine situation, something we just don't need to be in, and yes, I know, I'll be called a liberal but honest readers who have followed me for some time know that's not the case.",
    "\nNotice some things that are taking place in Iran that the plan speaks about.",

    "\n\u201cU.S.",
    "\nsupport for these independence movements, both overt and covert, could force the regime to focus attention on them and limit its ability to conduct other malign activities.\u201d\n\u201cThe probability the current Iranian theocracy will stop its nuclear program willingly or even under significant pressure is low,\u201d the plan states.",
    "\n\u201cAbsent a change in government within Iran, America will face a choice between accepting a nuclear-armed Iran or acting to destroy as much of this capability as possible.\u201d\nPresident Trump did made clear earlier in the week that we must make efforts to differentiate between the people of Iran and its ruling regime.",
    "\nWell, I agree, but that gets real messy when you start intervening in this manner.",
    "\n\u201cAny public discussion of these options, and any messaging about the Iranian regime in general, should make a bright line distinction between the theocratic regime along with its organs of oppression and the general populace,\u201d according to the plan.",
    "\n\u201cWe must constantly reinforce our support for removing the iron sandal from the necks of the people to allow them the freedom they deserve.\u201d\nBut the Trump administration has spoken out on other countries where the people want their independence.",
    "\nRemember the Kurds?",
    "\nHow about the people in the Catalan region of Spain?",
    "\nNo support for those people, and why?",
    "\nCause it's not part of the agenda.",
    "\nI say if the Iranian people want their freedom, let them first free themselves from the bondage of Islam, and then let the passion that burns inside men to be free rise up as it did in our forefathers due to the teachings fo the Holy Scriptures and stand and fight.",
    "\nThen, they will be in a position to ask for aid, but only then."

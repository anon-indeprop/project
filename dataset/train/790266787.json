    "\nThe third accuser is Julie Swetnick, a 55-year-old certified systems engineer, who on Wednesday claimed that in the early 1980s Kavanaugh and others spiked the drinks of young women at high school parties with intoxicants to clear the way for them to be gang-raped.",

    "\n\u201cHe is just looking for attention and doesn\u2019t want people to look at his past record and relationships - a total low-life!\u201d\nHe rejected Swetnick\u2019s allegations as \u201canother beauty\u201d and described Avenatti as a \u201ccon artist.\u201d\n\u201cAll of a sudden, the hearings are over, and the rumors start coming out,\u201d Trump said.",

    "\nA fourth accuser popped up yesterday, Politico reports.",
    "\nAccording to an interview transcript released Wednesday night by the Senate Judiciary Committee:\nAn anonymous woman wrote to Sen. Cory Gardner\u2019s (R-Colo.) office on Sept. 22 alleging that the Supreme Court nominee shoved another woman \u201cup against the wall very aggressively and sexually\u201d in 1998 after leaving a bar where both had been drinking, the transcript states.",
    "\nKavanaugh denied any involvement in the events alleged in that complaint, which was first reported by NBC.",
    "\nDepending on how you do the counting, there may even be a fifth and sixth accusation against Kavanaugh.",
    "\nThe newspaper account continues:\nThe transcript of Kavanaugh's Tuesday interview also cited another anonymous claim of sexual misconduct involving Kavanaugh, dating back to 1985 and sent to the office of Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), which the judge also flatly denied to investigators.",
    "\nAnd GOP investigators said late Wednesday they received an additional anonymous claim of rape passed along by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.).",

    "\nRamirez alleges she was assaulted by Kavanaugh at a drunken party decades ago at Yale College.",
    "\nShe claims Kavanaugh exposed himself to her and brushed his genitals against her.",
    "\nIf Kavanaugh isn\u2019t on the bench Monday, the Supreme Court will be shorthanded as it begins hearing cases in its new term.",
    "\nIt normally has a complement of nine justices but with Anthony Kennedy\u2019s retirement July 31, which cleared the way for Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination, there have been only eight justices.",
    "\nRoughly speaking there is a 4-to-4 liberal to conservative ideological split on the court.",
    "\nDemocrats are trying to drag the confirmation process into the next Congress where they may seize control from Republicans.",
    "\nElection Day is November 6.",
    "\nThe GOP currently controls the Senate, which has the final say on judicial nominations, by an uncomfortably close margin of 51 to 49.",
    "\nThe proceedings Thursday are supposed to get underway at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time.",
    "\nCommittee Republicans considered the political optics and didn\u2019t relish the prospect of their all-male team of 11 senators questioning a woman so they hired sex-crimes prosecutor Rachel Mitchell of Maricopa County, Arizona, to ask the questions at what promises to be a highly-watched hearing.",
    "\nDemocrats predictably freaked out at the decision to have a woman lead the questioning since their primary objective here is to embarrass and discredit Kavanaugh and other Republicans, not get at the truth.",
    "\n\u201cIt is going against everything I\u2019ve seen for 44 years,\" huffed committee member Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.).",
    "\n\"They\u2019re not following normal procedure.\"",
    "\nAs expected, at today\u2019s hearing Kavanaugh will firmly rebut the increasingly outrageous claims being leveled at him.",
    "\nAccording to prepared testimony provided to The Hill newspaper, he will say:\nI categorically and unequivocally deny the allegation against me by Dr. Ford.",
    "\nI never had any sexual or physical encounter of any kind with Dr. Ford.",
    "\nI am not questioning that Dr. Ford may have been sexually assaulted by some person in some place at some time.",
    "\nBut I have never done that to her or to anyone.",
    "\nKavanaugh added: \"I am innocent of this charge.\"",
    "\nNot surprisingly Ford\u2019s prepared testimony also found its way to reporters.",
    "\n\u201cI am here today not because I want to be,\u201d Ford says in her opening statement.",
    "\n\u201cI am terrified.",
    "\nI am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school.\u201d\nShe describes the nominee as \u201cBrett Kavanaugh, the boy who sexually assaulted me,\u201d and claims \u201cBrett\u2019s assault on me drastically altered my life,\u201d but at the same time acknowledges \u201cBrett did not rape me.\u201d\nGiven that Kavanaugh has already passed six incredibly intrusive FBI investigations, odds are Ford is lying or suffering from some kind of psychological disorder such as false memory syndrome.",
    "\nMany commentators have drawn parallels between Ford and Anita Hill, who in 1991 accused then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual improprieties.",
    "\nBoth women are college professors.",
    "\nBoth claim to have reluctantly been drawn into confirmation battles.",
    "\nFord claims to be a victim of attempted rape; Hill claims to have been a victim of sexual harassment in the workplace.",
    "\nOnly left-wingers and feminists like Maureen Dowd still believe Hill, now an utterly undistinguished politically correct scholar who discredited herself by \u2013among other things\u2014 following her then-boss Thomas as his subordinate when he switched jobs.",
    "\nAn abused person wouldn\u2019t do that.",
    "\nBut all the lies about Thomas at what he described as a \u201chigh-tech lynching for uppity blacks\u201d had an effect.",
    "\nIn the end, the Senate barely approved his nomination 52 to 48 on October 15, 1991.",
    "\nWith all the mud Democrats have been slinging at Kavanaugh, he would be thrilled to be approved by a margin as wide as 52 to 48.",
    "\nConservatives need to remember that the purpose of the Left\u2019s frenzied, demagogic assault is to damage the nominee, and by extension, the president who nominated him.",
    "\nIf they can derail Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination, that is an added bonus.",
    "\nThe Left\u2019s attacks on Kavanaugh in the #MeToo era are working, a USA Today article suggests:\nDisapproval for Kavanaugh \u2026 is at an unprecedented level for a Supreme Court nominee amid the allegations against him, according to a new USA TODAY/Ipsos Public Affairs Poll.",
    "\nThose surveyed said by 40 percent to 31 percent that the Senate shouldn't vote to approve his nomination, the first time a plurality of Americans have opposed a Supreme Court nominee since polling on the issue began.",
    "\nThe case against confirming Kavanaugh may be somewhere between weak and non-existent, but the constant repetition of the unsupported allegations in the Trump-hating media is clearly taking its toll on the nominee.",
    "\nThat said, the Senate Judiciary Committee is tentatively scheduled to vote on the nomination Friday at 9:30 a.m.\n\"If we're ready to vote, we will vote,\u201d Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) tweeted Tuesday at 6:46 p.m. \u201cIf we aren't ready, we won't.\u201d\nObviously, a lot is riding on the confirmation.",
    "\n\u201cWe're watching a period where what we have to understand is this is about raw power,\" former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) said Tuesday.",
    "\n\"And if the Left can stop Kavanaugh we will not get another conservative justice in our lifetime on the Supreme Court.\"",
    "\nPresident Trump quoted the nation\u2019s most prominent conservative radio host as he urged GOP senators to get onboard Tuesday:\n\u201cRush Limbaugh to Republicans: \u2018You can kiss the MIDTERMS goodbye if you don\u2019t get highly qualified Kavanaugh approved.\u2019\u201d\nTrump is right."

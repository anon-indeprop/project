    "\n\u201c\u2018Take the guns first, go through due process second,\u2019 Trump said.",

    "\nHere are the six states where the legislatures have already passed\u2014or the governor has already issued an executive order implementing\u2014\u201cred flag\u201d laws:\nCalifornia\nConnecticut\nIndiana\nOregon\nWashington\nRhode Island\nAnd since Trump\u2019s Stalinist statements, there are at least 24 additional states that are currently considering passing \u201cred flag\u201d laws.",

    "\nThis report is from Seattle:Doubtless, many other states are also considering passing \u201cred flag\u201d laws.",
    "\n\u201cThe city\u2019s police department became the first law enforcement agency in the state to force the surrender of a firearm under a new law known as an \u2018extreme risk protection order.\u2019\n\u201cThe incident involves a man who lives in Belltown, who neighbors said had been intimidating people for the past year \u2013 even staring-down customers through store-front windows with a gun holstered at his side.",
    "\n\u201cMental illness is suspected, but that new law allowed police to legally disarm him.\u201d\n\u201cThe man, who we are not naming, is also well known to the bars and restaurants below his unit along Second Ave.",
    "\nThe volume of complaints convinced Seattle police to seek an extreme risk protection order \u2013 or \u2018erpo\u2019 \u2013 which allows law enforcement to legally remove guns from people deemed a danger to themselves or others.",
    "\n\u201cIn this case, the man refused to comply.",
    "\nBecause of the new law, police were then able to return with a warrant and force the man to surrender the firearm.\u201d\n\u201cA few dozen erpos have been served and executed around the state, but Seattle police said they are the only agency so far to seize a gun because the owner refused to hand it over.",
    "\n\u201cLaw enforcement professionals said these specialized protection orders could be a common sense strategy to try and prevent mass shootings \u2013 such as what happened in Parkland, Florida.",
    "\n\u201c\u2018There\u2019s certainly a big concern of the connection between mental health and people exhibiting violent behavior and whether or not they should have access to firearms.",
    "\nThe \u201cerpos\u201d give us that tool now as an option,\u2019 said Sgt.",
    "\nEric Pisconski, who leads the crisis response unit for the Seattle Police Department.",
    "\n\u201cThe confiscations only last a year, although they can be renewed.\u201d\nSee the report here:\nSeattle Police First In State To Seize Gun Under Mental Health Law\nA few observations are in order here:\nFirst, the open carry of a firearm is LEGAL in the area where this took place.",
    "\nSo, the fellow was violating NO gun laws whatsoever.",
    "\nPlus, he never removed the pistol from its holster or brandished it in any way.",
    "\nSecondly, the man was \u201cknown\u201d to nearby bars and restaurants near his place of residence.",
    "\nThat means nothing.",
    "\nKnown for what?",
    "\nThe report doesn\u2019t even say the man was known for acting weirdly or strangely.",
    "\nIt just says he was \u201cknown.\u201d And even if he did act weirdly or strangely, if we denied constitutional rights to everyone in that category, a majority of Americans would have no rights, and ALL of Congress would have no rights.",
    "\nThirdly, what does \u201cvolume of complaints\u201d mean?",
    "\nHow many complaints were received over a YEAR\u2019S time?",
    "\nTwo?",
    "\nFive?",
    "\nTen?",

    "\nFourthly, there was NO report of the man \u201cexhibiting violent behavior,\u201d as the police sergeant claims.",
    "\nThe report says \u201che had been intimidating people.\u201d How?",

    "\nWow!",
    "\nRun for your lives!",
    "\nFifthly, a U.S. citizen who has committed NO CRIME is denied his Natural right of self-defense for a whole year.",
    "\nAnd the media report says the confiscations \u201conly\u201d last a year, with the caveat that they may be extended.",
    "\nIndeed.",
    "\nThey could and very likely will be extended indefinitely.",
    "\nHow many defenseless (unarmed) people are robbed, assaulted, accosted, beaten up, raped, wounded, paralyzed, or killed in a year\u2019s time?",
    "\nIt seems many politicians (and many police officers themselves) will not be content until every American citizen is totally defenseless and unable to protect him or herself.",
    "\nI tell you this with all seriousness: At some point, the American people will be forced to view these governmental attacks against our Second Amendment liberties as a declaration of war.",
    "\nSixthly, the man quoted in the news story who had complained about the armed fellow did so because he said he didn\u2019t like the sight of the man carrying a firearm, as it made him \u201cafraid.\u201d\nSO WHAT?",
    "\nThat the mere sight of a law-abiding citizen openly carrying a sidearm would make someone \u201cafraid\u201d is not sufficient reason to deny the citizen his constitutional right to keep and \u201cbear\u201d arms.",
    "\nThis \u201cI\u2019m offended\u201d or \u201chis gun scares me\u201d complaint is nothing but cover for little Nazis to try and deny another person their Natural, God-given liberty.",
    "\nBut under this new \u201cred flag\u201d law in Washington State, police are now able to confiscate a person\u2019s firearm without the person committing ANY crime\u2014or even threatening to commit a crime.",
    "\nEven when police forced the man to surrender his firearm, the man made no threatening gesture toward the officers.",
    "\nGun confiscation has started in America\u2014and President Trump\u2019s Stalinist statements about taking guns first and worrying about due process later is the banner under which this is happening.",
    "\nWhen Trump promised to add \u201cmental health\u201d regulations to gun purchases and ownership, he opened Pandora\u2019s Box.",
    "\nI go into the \u201cmental health\u201d trap in more detail in this column:\nTrump Set To Enact More Gun Control\n\u201cMental health\u201d regulations for gun ownership is what extremist gun grabbers Schumer, Pelosi, Feinstein, et al., have been trying to accomplish for decades.",
    "\nNow, it is the \u201cpro-gun\u201d Republican President Donald Trump who is the one making it happen.",
    "\nKris Kobach is the Secretary of State of Kansas.",
    "\nHe is a former professor of constitutional law at UMKC Law School.",
    "\nHe wrote an excellent analysis of the constitutional violations of these \u201cred flag\u201d laws:\nThe seizure of guns without any hearing at all.",
    "\nThe laws all contain an \u201cex parte\u201d provision that allows the state to temporarily seize a person\u2019s guns without even notifying the gun owner or giving him a chance to be heard.",
    "\nThis is the quintessential denial of due process.",
    "\nThe Fourth Amendment makes clear that a person cannot be denied of liberty (to exercise one\u2019s constitutional right to bear arms) without due process of law.",
    "\nThis confiscation is \u201ctemporary,\u201d but it can easily lead to long-term or permanent confiscation.",
    "\nBased on the testimony of one unrelated person.",
    "\nThe confiscation order can be based on the testimony of only one person claiming that the gun owner poses a risk to the safety of himself or others.",
    "\nThe law deceptively says that it has to be the testimony of a \u201cfamily member.\u201d [Most of the \u201cred flag\u201d laws, such as the one in Washington State, do not limit who can claim the gun owner poses a risk to the safety of himself or others to family members.]",
    "\nBut \u201cfamily member\u201d is defined to include \u201cformer dating partners\u201d and anyone who has ever lived with the defendant.",
    "\nSo a jilted former boyfriend or girlfriend, or even a roommate from years ago, could easily set in motion the disarming of a lawful gun owner.",
    "\nUsing a very low standard of proof.",
    "\nThe standard for obtaining an ex parte order against a gun owner is absurdly low \u2013 one need only show \u201creasonable cause\u201d to believe that the person may pose a risk.",
    "\nThat\u2019s even lower than the \u201cprobable cause\u201d standard for obtaining a search warrant.",
    "\nIn addition, the judge is forced to rush his decision and issue the confiscation order on the same day of the ex parte hearing.",
    "\nWithin two weeks of the ex parte hearing, a hearing with the gun owner present must occur; the purpose is to put in place a long-term confiscation order.",
    "\nBut even at that hearing, the standard of proof is far below the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard used in criminal trials.",
    "\nRather, it need only be shown by \u201ca preponderance of evidence\u201d that the person poses a risk of injury to self or others.",
    "\nWhat kind of evidence?",
    "\nThings like the \u201creckless storage\u201d of firearms and drinking habits can be considered.",
    "\nIf you keep a handgun in the bedside table and drink beer regularly, you may [be] in trouble.",
    "\nShifting the burden of proof to the gun owner.",
    "\nThe long-term confiscation order lasts up to a year, but may be renewed indefinitely.",
    "\nOnce it is in place, it becomes very difficult to remove.",
    "\nTo have the confiscation order lifted, the gun owner must provehe does not pose a threat to himself or others.",
    "\nProving a negative is nearly impossible.",
    "\nAdding insult to injury, the bill even authorizes local law enforcement to charge the gun owner a storage fee for confiscating and storing his guns.",
    "\nAfter the Parkland school shooting, had Donald Trump simply used his bully pulpit to promote arming teachers and school employees as a deterrent and defense against these school shootings without calling for more gun control, it would have been a HUGE boost for the Second Amendment in general and school safety in particular.",
    "\nInstead, Trump fell in with anti-Second Amendment liberals and started calling for more gun control, adding \u201cmental health\u201d restrictions to gun purchases and making his stupid Stalinist statements about taking guns first and worrying about due process later.",
    "\nAs a result, anti-gun liberals all over the country are using Trump\u2019s own words and proposed gun control policies as a rallying cry to enact gun confiscation laws.",
    "\nAs it stands right now, Donald Trump has opened the door for more damage being done to the Second Amendment than any other president, Democrat or Republican, in our lifetime.",
    "\nFreedomists in the 50 states had better keep a close eye on their State legislatures this year and next, because, thanks to Donald Trump, gun confiscation is going to be on the agenda in virtually every single State in the country.",
    "\nAnd while you are at it, don\u2019t overlook the federal Congress.",
    "\nNo wonder Dianne Feinstein looked so deliriously (and devilishly) happy when Trump uttered his stupid comment about gun confiscation and said he wanted to bring an assault weapons ban (Feinstein\u2019s bill) into proposed gun control legislation.",
    "\nSee the video here:\nWatch Dianne Feinstein Erupt With Glee After Trump Seems To Endorse Her Assault Weapons Ban\nBut if you are a freedom-loving American who values your liberties and the God-given right to defend them, happy is NOT what you should be feeling right now.",
    "\nYou should be OUTRAGED at Donald Trump, and you should be absolutely determined to be ever vigilant against ANY attempt from Democrats or Republicans from federal, State, or municipal government to enact further restrictions against your right to keep and bear arms\u2014because Trump has opened the door not only for more gun control but also for gun confiscation.",
    "\nP.S.",
    "\nOne more time I want to remind readers that self-defense\u2014including defense against tyrannical government\u2014is more than a right guaranteed in the Second Amendment to our Constitution; it is a duty assigned us in Nature by our Creator.",
    "\nFor anyone, especially a Christian, to willingly surrender their means of self-defense is not only a crime against liberty; it is a sin against God.",
    "\nI urge my Christian friends (and anyone else) to read the book my constitutional attorney son and I wrote entitled \u201cTo Keep or Not To Keep: Why Christians Should Not Give Up Their Guns.\u201d\nMark it down: Any law demanding the citizenry to surrender their AR-15 rifles would be unconstitutional, unnatural, and unbiblical.",
    "\nAnd NO Christian or other free man should ever comply with such a law.",
    "\nI know that there is a plethora of pastors who teach that Christians ought to obey the government should it outlaw our guns.",
    "\nTHEY ARE WRONG.",
    "\nThey are wrong biblically, constitutionally, and morally.",
    "\nOur book shows the Natural and Biblical duty of self-defense.",
    "\nI don\u2019t know of another book like it.",

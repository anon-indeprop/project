    "Security Guard Jesus Campos Shot During The Vegas Massacre Raises New Questions About Official Narrative\n\nThe infamous security guard at the Mandalay Bay Hotel, who was allegedly shot stopping the massacre in Las Vegas over a week ago is not listed or registered as such.",
    "\nJesus Campos, who the narrative is constantly changing around, is still a source of mystery.",
    "\nSo who is Jesus Campos?",
    "\nThat burning question has bothered many since the release of his name, but there\u2019s been no photograph of this alleged hero, even though we\u2019ve already seen crime scene images of the guns Stephen Paddock allegedly dragged up to his 32nd-floor hotel room.",
    "\nThe ever-changing narrative now though, seems to swirl around this unknown mystery security guard.",
    "\nAt first, Campos, a guard at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, was hailed a hero for helping guide police to gunman Stephen Paddock\u2019s room on the 32nd floor.",
    "\nPolice said Campos was shot in the leg at the end of Paddock\u2019s assault on concertgoers\u2014potentially distracting the gunman and causing him to panic and kill himself.",
    "\nBut now, questions have been raised after Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo revised the timeline and said Campos had actually been shot about 9:59 p.m. a (full six minutes before the mass shooting began at 10:05 p.m.) which means the guard could have instead led Paddock to start opening fire on the crowd for fear of being caught.",
    "\nPolice have said it was difficult to identify the source of the bullets during the attack, and the confusion added more minutes to their lengthy response.",
    "\nBut the revised timeline shows officers would have known where Paddock was before the mass shooting even started.",
    "\nDid Campos call 911?",
    "\nWhat happened during those six minutes?",
    "\nMuch of Campos\u2019s story and background remains a mystery.",
    "\n\u2013Newsweek\nCampos\u2019s co-worker Liliana Rodriguez started a GoFundMe account for him on October 3, explaining that he\u2019d been shot while on \u201crandom patrol\u201d and it could have been anyone of us.",
    "\n\u201cFunds will be used to provide relief and financial support for him while he gets back on his feet,\u201d Rodriguez\u2019s online petition says.",
    "\n\u201cThis is a young man that I work with day in and day out.",
    "\nAny financial support would be appreciated for the time he would need to recover.\u201d\nStrangely, a picture of Campos wasn\u2019t displayed as part of the fund because Rodriguez indicated that \u201cdue to privacy from the media we do not feel comfortable publishing a photo.\u201d\nThere are obviously certain things that the FBI and other investigators seem intent on covering up.",
    "\nTheir own narrative is quickly shattering.",
    "\nLas Vegas Metro Police Undersheriff Kevin McMahill explained more about Campos\u2019s actions the night of the shooting, helping fill in some of what happened ahead of the attack, but unfortunately, it only added more questions and gave little in the way of answers.",
    "\nMcMahill told KNPR, a local NPR affiliate, that Campos went up to the 32nd floor to investigate a door alarm.",
    "\nWhile on the 32nd floor, he found that a stairwell door was jammed and radioed down to maintenance.",
    "\nCampos heard a drilling sound and thought it was odd.",
    "\nA maintenance worker came up to the 32nd floor.",
    "\nAs the pair started talking, Paddock began firing through the door of his room, first with a single-fire gun and then with a rapid-fire rifle.",
    "\nPolice have said that when Campos radioed what happened, it helped them track where Paddock was holed up \u2013 so why change the narrative to make it even more unbelievable?",
    "\nAnd still, none of this explains why Campos is not registered as a security guard either, and why the timeline is being changed publically.",
    "\nWhat exactly do they want us to believe?",

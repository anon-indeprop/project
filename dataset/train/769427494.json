    "\nIn Newly Obtained Memo, Congress\u2019 Top Cop Said House Democratic Caucus Server VANISHED https://t.co/gTj2UgSZJr via @dailycaller \u2014 Luke Rosiak (@lukerosiak) July 2, 2018\nA secret memo marked \u201cURGENT\u201d detailed how the House Democratic Caucus\u2019s server went \u201cmissing\u201d soon after it became evidence in a cybersecurity probe.",
    "\nThe secret memo also said more than \u201c40 House offices may have been victims of IT security violations.\u201d\nIn the memo, Congress\u2019s top law enforcement official, Sergeant-at-Arms Paul Irving, along with Chief Administrative Officer Phil Kiko, wrote, \u201cWe have concluded that the employees [Democratic systems administrator Imran Awan and his family] are an ongoing and serious risk to the House of Representatives, possibly threatening the integrity of our information systems and thereby members\u2019 capacity to serve constituents.\u201d\nThe memo, addressed to the Committee on House Administration (CHA) and dated Feb. 3, 2017, was recently reviewed and transcribed by The Daily Caller News Foundation.",
    "\nThe letter bolsters TheDCNF\u2019s previous reporting about the missing server and evidence of fraud on Capitol Hill.",
    "\nIt details how the caucus server, run by then-caucus Chairman Rep. Xavier Becerra, was secretly copied by authorities after the House Inspector General (IG) identified suspicious activity on it, but the Awans\u2019 physical access was not blocked.",
    "\nBut after, the report reads, the server appears to have been secretly replaced with one that looked similar.",
    "\nThe memo called for firing the Pakistani-born aides, revoking all their computer accounts, and changing the locks on any door they had access to.",
    "\nRep. Louie Gohmert \u2014 a Texas Republican on the House Committee on the Judiciary who has done oversight work on the case \u2014 said the missing server contained copies of Congress members\u2019 emails.",
    "\n\u201cThey put 40 members of Congress\u2019s data on one server \u2026 That server, with that serial number, has disappeared,\u201d he said.",
    "\nMultiple sources connected to the investigation told TheDCNF that shortly after an IG report came out identifying the House Democratic Caucus server as key evidence in a criminal probe, the evidence was stolen.",
    "\n\u201cThey [the Awans] deliberately turned over a fake server\u201d to falsify evidence, one official close to the CHA alleged.",
    "\n\u201cIt was a breach.",
    "\nThe data was completely out of [members\u2019] possession.\u201d\nThe six-page letter says:\n\u2022 In September of 2016 \u2026 the CHA and [IG] briefed the former Chairman of the Democratic Caucus about suspicious activity related to their server that the [IG] identified.",
    "\nAs a result, the former Chairman of the Democratic Caucus directed the CAO to copy the data from their server and two computers.",
    "\n\u2022 The CHA directed the IG to refer the matter to the US Capitol Police.",
    "\nThe USCP initiated an investigation that continues to this day.",
    "\n\u2022 In late 2016, the former Chairman of the Democratic Caucus announced his intention to resign from Congress to assume a new position.",
    "\nThe CAO and [sergeant-at-arms] worked with the Chairman to account for his inventory, including the one server.",
    "\n\u2022 While reviewing the inventory, the CAO discovered that the serial number of the server did not match that of the one imaged in September.",
    "\n[Investigators] also discovered that the server in question [the replacement server] was still operating under the employee\u2019s control, contrary to the explicit instructions of the former chairman to turn over all equipment and fully cooperate with the inquiry and investigation.",
    "\n[A House source said the \"employee\u201d was Abid Awan.]",
    "\n\u2022 The USCP interviewed relevant staff regarding the missing server.",
    "\n\u2022 On January 24, 2017, the CAO acquired the [r[replacement]erver from the control of the employees and transferred that server to the USCP.",
    "\nPresident Donald Trump referenced the Democratic Caucus\u2019 missing server in a tweet.",
    "\nBut because the letter to the CHA was kept secret, many news outlets have not grasped that the House\u2019s top cop documented a \u201cmissing server\u201d connected to the Democratic Caucus.",
    "\nThe timeline laid out in the letter also shows that Becerra \u2014 now California\u2019s Democratic attorney general \u2014 failed to ensure that the Awans didn\u2019t have access to House computer systems during the 2016 election, which was wrought with cybersecurity scandals.",
    "\nAn IG presentation from September 2016 shows that Becerra knew of problems months before the server disappeared.",
    "\n\u201cThe Caucus Chief of Staff requested one of the shared employees to not provide IT services or access their computers,\u201d it read.",
    "\n\u201cThis shared employee continued.\u201d It\u2019s unclear why that request was not granted or why it was a request rather than an order.",
    "\nA House official close to the probe said the employee was Abid, who was not on Becerra or the Caucus\u2019s payroll.",
    "\nThe official said Becerra Chief of Staff Sean McCluskie apparently knew Abid was accessing Caucus servers.",
    "\nAccording to payroll records, Abid\u2019s sister-in-law, Hina Alvi, was the Caucus\u2019 systems administrator.",
    "\nThe Awans\u2019 continued physical access to Becerra\u2019s equipment after red flags emerged enabled the server to disappear after it became evidence, House officials close to the investigation told TheDCNF.",
    "\n(RELATED: Becerra Tried To Block Awan From House Democratic Caucus Server, But Logins Continued; He Didn\u2019t Go To Cops)\nBecerra has refused to comment, citing an ongoing criminal investigation.",
    "\nThe February 2017 memo itemizes \u201cnumerous and egregious violations of House IT security\u201d by members of the Awan family, including using Congress members\u2019 usernames and \u201cthe unauthorized storage of sensitive House information outside the House.\u201d\n\u201cThese employees accessed user accounts and computers for offices that did not employ them, without the knowledge and permission of the impacted Member\u2019s office,\u201d it said, adding, \u201c4 of the employees accessed the Democratic Caucus computers 5,735 times.\u201d More than 100 office computers were open to access from people not on the office\u2019s staff, it said.",
    "\nChris Gowen \u2014 a former aide to Hillary Clinton who is now serving as Imran\u2019s attorney \u2014 told TheDCNF, \u201cThere is no missing server and never was.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t provide any support for his claim, which is contrary to evidence Kiko and Irving presented to Congress.",
    "\nThe memo said the CHA possesses voluminous evidence, including, \u201cInterview notes with House Members\u2019 Chiefs of Staff,\u201d and \u201cLogon activity and computer access logs.\u201d Prosecutors have not brought charges.",
    "\nThe Awans were banned from Congress\u2019s computer network the day the letter was sent, and Kiko held a briefing to convey the message to chiefs of staff for members who employed them.",
    "\nBut Democrats claim they were never told about any of the cybersecurity issues itemized in the urgent memo.",
    "\nRep. Jackie Speier \u2014 a California Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence who employed Imran and his wife, Hina Alvi \u2014 said she never heard of any missing server.",
    "\nJoaquin Castro of Texas \u2014 another Democratic intelligence committee member who employed one of the Awans \u2014 told TheDCNF that Kiko never told him of any cybersecurity issues whatsoever and that the Awan probe was instead described as a theft issue.",
    "\nIndeed, the CHA issued only one public statement on the case and titled it the \u201cHouse Theft Investigation\u201d \u2014 wording that avoids cybersecurity words while political news coverage raged about other cybersecurity issues in the 2016 election.",
    "\nYet even the alleged theft has not resulted in criminal charges \u2014 even though the letter also says House authorities have \u201cpurchase orders and vouchers\u201d that allegedly show procurement fraud, as well as testimony from a Democratic chief of staff to Rep. Yvette Clarke, who warned of procurement fraud.",
    "\nThe FBI arrested Imran at the airport in July 2017 for alleged bank fraud that occurred six months prior, and Democrats have since claimed that the case is about nothing but bank fraud.",
    "\nBank fraud does not explain why the Awans were kicked off the House network concurrent with the urgent memo, which did not cite bank fraud.",
    "\nA Democratic IT aide who alleged that Imran solicited a bribe from him told TheDCNF he believes members of Congress are playing dumb and covering the matter up.",
    "\nWendy Anderson, a former chief of staff to New York Rep. Yvette Clarke, told House investigators that she suspected that her predecessor, Shelley Davis, was working with Abid on a theft scheme, but Clarke refused to fire Abid until outside investigators got involved, TheDCNF reported.",
    "\nEighteen months after the evidence was recounted in the urgent memo, prosecution appears to have stalled for reasons not publicly explained.",
    "\nImran is in court July 3 for a possible plea deal in the bank fraud case.",
    "\nGohmert said the FBI has refused to accept evidence demonstrating alleged House misconduct, and some witnesses with first-hand knowledge say the bureau has not interviewed them.",

    "\nWait!",
    "\nIt\u2019s all a MISTRANSLATION!",
    "\n\nThus, it took more than a year-and-a-half for the Factory to roll out the old reliable \u201cmistranslation\u201d defense to explain away the infamous paragraph 303 of Amoris Laetita (AL), which reads as follows in the official English translation on the Vatican website:\nYet conscience can do more than recognize that a given situation does not correspond objectively to the overall demands of the Gospel.",
    "\nIt can also recognize with sincerity and honesty what for now is the most generous response which can be given to God, and come to see with a certain moral security that it is what God himself is asking amid the concrete complexity of one\u2019s limits, while yet not fully the objective ideal.",
    "\nIn other words, the conscience can \u201cinform\u201d a sinner that his continued sinning is not only acceptable to God but is even what God is asking \u201cfor now,\u201d given one\u2019s particular \u201climits.\u201d This outrageous proposition, a form of situation ethics that strikes at the very foundation of Catholic moral teaching, has justly provoked a storm of criticism from lay and clerical defenders of the authentic Magisterium.",
    "\n\nBut it\u2019s all a misunderstanding, say Dr. Robert Fastiggi, professor of Systematic Theology at Sacred Heart Major Seminary, and Dr.",
    "\nDawn Eden Goldstein, S.T.D., professor of Dogmatic Theology at Holy Apostles College and Seminary.",
    "\nAll of the critics of AL are wrong\u2014every one of them!\u2014because, you see, the original Latin text does not say what the English text does.",
    "\nDr. Robert Fastiggi and Dr.",
    "\nDawn Goldstein\nHere we go again.",
    "\nSo what does the Latin say?",
    "\nHere is the paragraph in the official Latin:\nHaec autem conscientia agnoscere potest non modo statum quendam ab universali Evangelii mandato obiective dissidere; etiam sincere honesteque agnoscere poteste quod sit liberale responsum in praesenti Deo reddendum atque eadem conscientia firma quadam morali certitudine intellegere illam esse oblationem quam ipse Deus requirit inter rerum impedientium congeriem, quamvis perfectum nondum sit obiectivum exemplar.",
    "\nYes, and so what?",
    "\nWell, according to Fastiggi and Goldstein, while the English translation reads: \u201cwhat for now is the most generous response which can be given to God,\u201d the Latin employs the word oblationem, which means offering.",
    "\nSo, What the Pope Really Means\u00ae is: \u201cwhat for now is the most generous offering which can be given to God.\u201d So, it\u2019s an offering to God, not a response to God.",
    "\nBig difference.",
    "\n\nBut just a moment: how can objectively immoral behavior ever be characterized as an \u201coffering\u201d to God?",
    "\nIt would seem the Latin version has graver implications than the English because it suggests that falling short of what the moral law requires is an oblation pleasing to God if one\u2019s \u201climits\u201d make obedience to the moral law difficult.",
    "\nAnd that is exactly the nonsense Fastiggi and Goldstein expect us to swallow: \u201cPope Francis is not talking about an offering of an objectively sinful action but a gift of self that moves toward God and the objective moral norm.\u201d\n\nSo, our intrepid presenters of What the Pope Really Means\u00ae would have us believe that objectively immoral behavior, which is the best one can do according \u201cthe \u201cconcrete complexity of one\u2019s limits,\u201d is no longer simply objectively immoral behavior but rather a gift of self because it moves toward morally licit behavior.",
    "\nFastiggi and Goldstein have managed to make the problem even worse in their attempt to explain it away.",
    "\n\nWhat about the English locution \u201cwhile yet not fully the objective ideal,\u201d which seems to reduce the negative precepts of the natural law to mere ideals?",
    "\nNot so, Fastiggi and Goldstein contend.",
    "\nDo not all those ignorant critics of AL know that the Latin text employs the phrase \u201cobiectivum exemplar,\u201d which, translated literally into English is \u201cobjective exemplar.\u201d They declare triumphantly: \u201cThe Latin term exemplar does not mean an unattainable ideal, it specifically means a pattern or model to follow.\u201d\n\nGive.",
    "\nMe.",
    "\nA.",
    "\nBreak.",
    "\nA pattern or model to follow is an ideal, as a standard Latin dictionary confirms with its definition of exemplar: \u201c(1) copy/reproduction, (2) model, pattern, example, original, ideal.",
    "\nLikewise, the definition of the English word \u201cexemplar\u201d is simply: \u201can ideal model.\u201d\n\nHere too Fastiggi and Goldsetein only worsen the problem they try to explain away.",
    "\nFor if moral behavior is now to be viewed as merely \u201cexemplary\u201d rather than divinely mandated by the natural law that binds all men\u2014including Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery\u2014then basic morality becomes a kind of heroic virtue.",
    "\nThus, continence cannot realistically be expected, at least \u201cfor now\u201d (AL 303), of the average Joe or Jane with an \u201cex\u201d who has \u201cremarried\u201d and is now mired in the \u201cconcrete complexity one\u2019s limits.\u201d\n\nSo, as Fastiggi and Goldstein would have it, all the tumult triggered by AL is just a misunderstanding caused by uninformed people who haven\u2019t consulted the Latin text\u2014including those ignorant Vatican translators.",
    "\nAccording to their proposed \u201calternate translation\u201d into English, What the Pope Really Means\u00ae is that objectively immoral behavior one feels unable to correct due to one\u2019s \u201climits\u201d is \u201cthe offering that God himself is asking amid the mass of impediments, although it may not yet be the perfect objective model.\u201d Which is what the official English translation already says but with fewer words.",
    "\n\nIt seems Fastiggi and Goldstein are hoping no one will notice that their linguistic tinkering produces no real change in meaning but only an intensification of its perniciousness.",
    "\nIndeed, their \u201cproposed alternate translation\u201d reduces the avoidance of adulterous relations in \u201csecond marriages\u201d to the \u201cperfect objective model.\u201d Now, how could anyone but a Pharisee expect perfection from people living in adultery?",
    "\nAre you perfect?",
    "\nThen again, the Pharisees are precisely the ones Our Lord condemned for accommodating divorce and remarriage in violation of the natural law.",
    "\nBut such embarrassing truths need not impede the Bergoglian Mercy Train as it barrels toward a train wreck at the end of the line.",
    "\nAnd Fastiggi and Goldstein are busily helping it along, changing red signals to green.",
    "\nNo problem here!",
    "\nhas been the mantra of the neo-Catholic establishment for nearly half a century of ecclesial auto-demolition.",
    "\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more!",
    "\nOur dynamic translators even provide their own dynamic interpretation of AL to mean that the \u201coffering\u201d to God of which Francis speaks is merely the decision by a divorced and \u201cremarried\u201d couple with children not to end their relationship, which would be the \u201cperfect objective model,\u201d but rather to \u201clive in continence until they may\u2014after the hoped for declaration of nullity\u2014enter into a true marriage.\u201d That is, they would have Francis affirming John Paul II\u2019s Familiaris consortio, which repeats the Church\u2019s constant teaching that continence is required of those who have entered into adulterous \u201csecond marriage,\u201d failing which they cannot be admitted to the sacraments.",
    "\n\nBut the Fastiggi-Goldstein interpretation is precisely the contrary of the interpretation Francis has assiduously promoted and which Fastiggi and Goldstein just as assiduously ignore: i.e., that people in \u201csecond marriages\u201d do not have to live in continence, but rather\u2014in \u201ccertain cases\u201d\u2014may continue their adulterous relations while receiving absolution and Holy Communion during a \u201cprocess of discernment.\u201d As we know, in his letter to the bishops of Buenos Aires, published on the Vatican website (in response to a query he himself may have solicited), Bergoglio informed them \u201cthere is no other interpretation.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the Maltese bishops' \u201cguidelines\u201d for implementing AL, published in L\u2019Osservatore Romano\u2014for which Bergoglio thanked them\u2014declare thus:\nIf, as a result of the process of discernment, undertaken with \u201chumility, discretion and love for the Church and her teaching, in a sincere search for God\u2019s will and a desire to make a more perfect response to it\u201d (AL 300), a separated or divorced person who is living in a new relationship manages, with an informed and enlightened conscience, to acknowledge and believe that he or she are at peace with God, he or she cannot be precluded from participating in the sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist (see AL, notes 336 and 351).",
    "\nThis Pope\u2019s plan of promulgating a deliberately ambiguous document whose heterodox interpretation and application he would later approve with a series of sub-magisterial winks and nods, both oral and written, is the reason I signed onto the Correctio Filialis.",
    "\nSee the piece by Joseph Shaw in this regard.",
    "\n\nShaw maintains that AL can be \u201cbent into some kind of orthodoxy.\u201d Perhaps.",
    "\nBut it is not our responsibility to bend a Pope\u2019s statements into conformity with the Faith.",
    "\nMoreover, any Pope who promulgates a document that can be read as orthodox only by a forced interpretation imposed by certain readers\u2014while others disagree\u2014has by that very fact inflicted grave harm upon on the Church, which he alone has the duty to correct.",
    "\nBut Francis, as any reasonable observer can see, has no intention of offering any such correction.",
    "\nQuite to the contrary, confusion as a cover for the introduction of Holy Communion for \u201ccertain\u201d public adulterers by Bergoglio\u2019s co-conspirators in the Vatican and various dioceses is exactly what he was aiming to achieve from the beginning of the whole synodal charade, which was merely a vehicle for promulgation of AL.",
    "\nAs Shaw observes of AL: \u201cWhat we [the signers of the Correctio] are saying is that it has become clear that orthodoxy is not what Pope Francis wants us to find there.\u201d\n\nIn a sense, what Bergoglio is doing is worse than explicit heresy, which could at least be readily identified and denounced as such.",
    "\nBut Bergoglio wants the effects of heresy\u2014undermining Holy Matrimony, Confession and Holy Communion, whose integrity is affirmed verbally\u2014without the guilt of an explicit promulgation.",
    "\nIn so acting, he is very much in the mold of Honorius I, who was posthumously anathematized by an ecumenical council (the Third Council of Constantinople) and by his own successor (Leo II) for aiding and abetting the spread of the Monothelite heresy (no human but only a divine will in Christ).",
    "\nHonorius did so by means of private correspondence with the author of the heresy, endorsing the heresy without ever formally proclaiming it as doctrine.",
    "\nAnd yet Honorius I is listed in the canon of the Popes and is not considered to have fallen from office on account of heresy.",
    "\nA similar judgment might well befall this Pope, but it is not for us to level it.",
    "\n\nMeanwhile, as Fastiggi and Goldstein labor to convince us that nothing is amiss with AL, Pope Bergoglio is sending clear signals of concern about the rising opposition among the faithful to his master plan to subvert the Church according to his false notion of mercy.",
    "\nIn a classic power move, he has just given a sop to Cardinal Burke, the perceived leader of the opposition, by appointing him to a minor position on the Apostolic Signatura\u2014the same tribunal from which Bergoglio brutally removed him as Prefect.",
    "\nAnd this after also humiliating Burke as the spiritual patron of the Knights of Malta, to which he was exiled after his removal.",
    "\n\nWill this sop buy Burke\u2019s silence, staving off the feared public correction?",
    "\nWe will soon know if the Cardinal can be bought so easily.",
    "\nBut this move demonstrates\u2014if more evidence were needed\u2014that Bergoglio has never been the humble apostle of mercy depicted in his carefully crafted public relations narrative, but rather a cunning ecclesiastical politician, constantly plotting and scheming to get what he wants.",
    "\nThat the neo-Catholic establishment refuses to recognize the grim reality of this unprecedented pontificate is but another page in the long annals of its shameful defense of the indefensible to the detriment of Holy Mother Church."

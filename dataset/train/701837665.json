    "The JFK Cover-Up Continues\n\nWhile the mainstream media was announcing for the past two weeks that President Trump was going to release the CIA\u2019s long-secret records on the JFK assassination, I took a different position.",

    "\nPlease, don\u2019t start calling me Nostradamus.",
    "\nA blind man could see what was happening.",

    "\nOn Thursday, the deadline established by law for releasing the records, the CIA undoubtedly blinked and Trump presumably got what he wanted in return for granting the CIA request for continued secrecy.",
    "\nTime to buy old US gold coins\nSome mainstream media commentators are criticizing the CIA for waiting until the very last day to make its case for continued secrecy.",

    "\nDon\u2019t forget: According to Trump\u2019s own tweets, he had already ostensibly decided to deny the CIA\u2019s request for secrecy before the Thursday deadline:\nTrump tweet sent on Saturday, October 21: \u201cSubject to the receipt of further information, I will be allowing, as President, the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened.\u201d Trump tweet sent on Wednesday, October 25: \u201cThe long anticipated release of the #JFKFiles will take place tomorrow.",
    "\nSo interesting!",
    "\nNow, it\u2019s theoretically possible that the CIA presented Trump with some earthshattering new information on the Thursday deadline that showed that the United States would fall into the ocean if Americans were finally permitted to see the CIA\u2019s long-secret JFK records.",
    "\nBut how likely is that?",
    "\nNot likely at all!",
    "\nInstead, it is a virtual certainly that when Art of the Deal Trump sent out those two tweets, he was sending a message to the CIA as part of the negotiations: Give me what I want or I will release the records.",

    "\nThe Kennedy Autopsy Jacob Hornberger Check Amazon for Pricing.",
    "\nIn the end, the CIA blinked, just as Trump knew it would.",
    "\nContrary to what the mainstream press is asserting, the records undoubtedly contain more incriminating circumstantial evidence that fills in the mosaic of a U.S. national-security regime-change operation on November 22, 1963.",
    "\nThat\u2019s what the mainstream media, forever wedded to the official story no matter how ridiculous and illogical it is, simply cannot bring themselves to confront.",
    "\nTrump knew that he had the CIA over a barrel.",
    "\nAs I indicated in my two articles this week, the CIA was between a rock and a hard place.",
    "\nOn the one hand, it could refuse to grant Trump what he wanted and let the records be released, which it knew would point to the CIA\u2019s guilt in the assassination.",
    "\nOn the other hand, it could give Trump what he wanted and have to suffer the obvious inference that people would draw \u2014 that the CIA was continuing to cover up incriminatory evidence.",
    "\nWhat did the CIA give Trump in return for Trump\u2019s extending the CIA\u2019s 50-year-plus secrecy?",
    "\nWe don\u2019t know, but my hunch is that it pertains to Russia.",
    "\nHere\u2019s my next prediction: the congressional investigations into Trump\u2019s supposed \u201ccollusion\u201d with Russia are about to fizzle out.",

    "\nIn my opinion, that\u2019s the price the CIA had to pay in return for its continued cover-up of its U.S. regime-change operation in November 1963.",
    "\nNotice something else about the deal that Trump has presumably made with the CIA: The secrecy arrangement extends only to April.",

    "\nNot surprisingly, the mainstream media isn\u2019t even questioning that ludicrous notion.",
    "\nFor more than 50 years, the CIA has known why it has wanted those particular records to be kept secret.",
    "\nDuring the term of the Assassination Records Review Board in the 1990s, the CIA decided to keep these particular records secret for another 25 years.",
    "\nThere are bound to be lots of CIA memoranda detailing why it was imperative to keep these particular records secret for as long as possible.",
    "\nFinally, the CIA made its request for secrecy to Trump at least several weeks ago.",
    "\nThe notion that the CIA suddenly hit Trump yesterday with a new argument as to why \u201cnational security\u201d would be threatened, after Trump had supposedly already rejected the arguments that had been presented to him, causing Trump to suddenly change his mind, is, well, laughable.",
    "\nSo, why the April deadline?",
    "\nWhy not extend the secrecy for another 25 years, which is undoubtedly what the CIA wanted?",
    "\nBecause Trump obviously needed collateral to ensure that the CIA complied with its part of the deal.",
    "\nIf Trump had extended the secrecy for 25 years, he would have lost leverage to ensure that the CIA complied with its part of the bargain.",
    "\nLet\u2019s say, hypothetically, that I\u2019m right: that the CIA agreed to use its assets in Congress to shut down the Russia investigation.",
    "\nTo make certain that the CIA fulfills its part of the bargain, Trump would need the April deadline so that the threat of the records release would continue hanging over the CIA.",
    "\nIf the CIA fails to fulfill its part of the bargain, Trump releases the records in April.",
    "\nIf the CIA squelches the Russia investigations, Trump grants another extension of time in April.",
    "\nLet\u2019s state the obvious: The CIA records that are still being suppressed have nothing to do with \u201cnational security.\u201d They have everything to do with covering up the CIA\u2019s role in the U.S. national-security regime-change operation that took place in Dallas in November 1963, which succeeded in ousting from power a president who was, in the eyes of the U.S. national-security establishment, engaged in actions The CIA, Terrorism, an... Jacob Hornberger Check Amazon for Pricing.",
    "\nthat constituted a grave threat to \u201cnational security,\u201d i.e., befriending the Russians (i.e., the Soviets) and Cubans and entering into peaceful coexistence with the communist world.",
    "\nIn other words, unlike Lee Harvey Oswald, who had absolutely no motive to kill President Kennedy, the national security establishment did have motive, a powerful motive, the same motive that motivated the CIA and Pentagon to target other political leaders for regime change or assassination around that time, such as Mohamad Mossadegh, Jacobo Arbenz, Patrice Lumumba (who Kennedy admired), Fidel Castro, and Salvador Allende.",
    "\nFor a more detailed analysis of motive, read FFF\u2019s ebook JFK\u2019s War with the National Security Establishment: Why Kennedy Was Assassinated by Douglas Horne, who served on the staff of the Assassination Records Review Board in the 1990s.",
    "\nImmediately upon the arrest of Lee Harvey Oswald, the official account was that this was just a lone nut, former U.S. Marine communist who decided, for no apparent reason, to assassinate Kennedy.",
    "\nOne big problem is the official story, however, requires a suspension of logic and common sense.",
    "\nFor anyone who has a mindset of conformity and deference to authority, that story makes sense because nothing is questioned or challenged.",
    "\nFor anyone who has a critical, analytical, independent mindset, the official story is filled with holes.",
    "\nFor example, how many communist Marines have you ever heard of?",
    "\nWhy would a genuine communist join the Marines in the first place, especially since the Marines had just recently killed millions of North Korean communists?",
    "\nWhy would a genuine communist join the Marines knowing that he could be called upon at any moment to go to Korea, Laos, Vietnam, Europe, or elsewhere to kill fellow communists?",
    "\nHow many communists do you know who like to kill fellow communists?",
    "\nIt gets better.",
    "\nCIA & JFK: The Secret ... Jefferson Morley Check Amazon for Pricing.",
    "\nAfter Oswald supposedly tried to defect to the Soviet Union and promised U.S. Embassy officials in Moscow that he was going to deliver classified information to the Soviet Union, which was America\u2019s sworn Cold War enemy (and former World War II partner and ally), U.S. officials permitted him to return home with a Red wife, without even one grand-jury summons or even an iota of harassment.",
    "\nThink about Martin Luther King, John Walker Lindh, Edward Snowden, the U.S. Communist Party, or the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.",
    "\nThink about how the U.S. national-security establishment treats what it suspects are communists or traitors.",
    "\nIt skewers them.",
    "\nWhy, just look at how they call Julian Assange a traitor and he isn\u2019t even an American.",
    "\nRecall the McCarthy hearings.",
    "\nDalton Trumbo.",
    "\nThe entire U.S. anti-communist crusade, including Vietnam, which more than 58,000 U.S. soldiers died killing communists.",
    "\nAnd they\u2019re going to tell us that they just let Lee Harvey Oswald, a supposed self-avowed communist skate blissfully across the Cold War stage of history with nary any abuse or harassment at all?",
    "\nDon\u2019t make me laugh.",
    "\nSoon after the Warren Commission was established, Warren called a super-secret meeting of the commission to address information that had come into Warren\u2019s possession.",
    "\nThat information was that Oswald was actually working for U.S. intelligence.",
    "\nYes, a spy, the type of people that work for the CIA.",
    "\nThat would make sense, especially given that the Marine Corps is a prime recruiting place for the CIA.",
    "\nSemper fidelis!",
    "\nNow, suddenly, all the circumstantial evidence in the Kennedy assassination falls into place.",
    "\nIt begins to make sense.",
    "\nThe mosaic starts to be filled out: They needed to get rid of Kennedy to protect national security and elevate Johnson, who had the same anti-communist mindset as the Pentagon and the CIA, to the presidency.",
    "\nUnlike JFK, who had begun withdrawing troops from Vietnam, Johnson would The Man Who Killed Ken... Roger Stone Check Amazon for Pricing.",
    "\nprotect national security by sending more troops to Vietnam.",
    "\nBut to avoid detection, they needed a patsy, which is the term that Oswald used after his arrest.",
    "\nThey needed to frame someone for the crime.",
    "\nAnd what better person to frame than a communist or an intelligence agent who the public would believe was a communist?",
    "\nPart of the scheme, obviously, would be to establish Oswald\u2019s communist bona fides.",
    "\nThat\u2019s why he was sent to New Orleans, where, contradictorily, he would work for a right-wing business owner, work with a right-wing former FBI agent, and conduct a public protest in favor of Fidel Castro and Cuba.",
    "\nIt was also why he was sent to Mexico City, where he would be ordered to visit the Cuban and Soviet Embassies, no doubt being told that he was being prepared for an important mission, maybe to enter Cuba to assassinate Castro.",
    "\nBut no government operation ever goes perfectly.",
    "\nThings obviously went dreadfully wrong with the Mexico City operation because the investigation into it after the assassination was quickly shut down.",
    "\nToday, it remains shrouded in mystery.",
    "\nAnd guess what is included in the records that Trump has now agreed to continue suppressing.",
    "\nYou guessed it!",
    "\nThe CIA\u2019s records relating to Mexico City!",
    "\nEver since the assassination, the CIA has argued that the release of any of its JFK records would threaten \u201cnational security.\u201d One thing is for sure and undeniable: Despite the release of many of the CIA\u2019s records in the 1990s and yesterday, the United States did not fall into the ocean or fall to the communists.",
    "\nAnd neither would it have done so if Trump had not granted the CIA\u2019s request for a continued cover-up of what it did on November 22, 1963.",

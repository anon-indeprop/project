    "\nBaldisseri notes that the upcoming Synod is to \u201cmake the entire Church aware of its important mission to accompany every young person, none excluded.\u201d\nThis papacy is awash in the prissy, pop psycho speak, jargon of accompaniment, listening, and dialogue dazzling the media with empty tropes and luring the uncatechized into its globalist mantra of one world new age religion.",
    "\nNot surprisingly, Baldisseri never once mentions that dreaded word, dogma in the Instrumentum Laboris, but effuses about accompaniment 136 times!",
    "\nThis doltish and dimwitted document wreaks of psycho babble, insults the intelligence of young people, and will destroy the future of the Church.",

    "Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch\u2026 Plus A Whole Lot More!",
    "\n\nInspector General Michael Horowitz\u2019 report on the FBI\u2019s handling of the Clinton email investigation has finally been released to the public and while it does indeed lambaste former FBI Director James Comey for his terrible judgment and handling of the Clinton investigation, it stops short of blaming it all on politics.",
    "\nHorowitz\u2019 report not only slams Comey, but it also criticizes former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, and immoral FBI philanderers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.",
    "\nHorowitz blames Comey, Strzok, and Page for besmirching the good name of the FBI and harming the agencies reputation with the American people.",

    "\nAt the end of the day, Horowitz was unable to find solid proof that the agency acted in a politically partisan and biased manner in the Clinton email case.",
    "\nHowever, the Inspector General left the door open to the possibility that political bias did indeed play a role, as his current investigation in the Russia-Collusion probe of the FBI and the DOJ could reveal new evidence to damn the FBI\u2019s Obama era leadership.",
    "\nWhile the report refuses to say conclusively that political bias was the animus behind the FBI\u2019s handling of the Clinton probe, it also indicates that IG Horowitz may have more to say about the FBI\u2019s political leanings in his Russia report.",
    "\nThe Washington Post explains:\nThe Justice Department inspector general on Thursday castigated former FBI Director James B. Comey for his actions during the Hillary Clinton email investigation and found that other senior bureau officials showed a \u201cwillingness to take official action\u201d to prevent Donald Trump from becoming president\u2026 Some senior bureau officials, the report found, exhibited a disturbing \u201cwillingness to take official action\u201d to hurt Trump\u2019s chances to become president.",
    "\nPerhaps the most damaging new revelation in the report is a previously-unreported text message in which Peter Strzok, a key investigator on both the Clinton email case and the investigation of Russia and the Trump campaign, assured an FBI lawyer in August 2016 that \u201cwe\u2019ll stop\u201d Trump from making it to the White House.",
    "\n\u201c[Trump\u2019s] not ever going to become president, right?",
    "\nRight?",
    "\n!\u201d the lawyer, Lisa Page, wrote to Strzok.",
    "\n\u201cNo.",
    "\nNo he won\u2019t.",
    "\nWe\u2019ll stop it,\u201d Strzok responded\u2026\nThe inspector general concluded that Strzok\u2019s text, along with others disparaging Trump, \u201cis not only indicative of a biased state of mind but, even more seriously, implies a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate\u2019s electoral prospects.\u201d\nThe messages \u201cpotentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations,\u201d the inspector general wrote\u2026\nStrzok has argued that he was just trying to reassure Page that Trump couldn\u2019t win, and that he wasn\u2019t implying that they would take action to stop his election.",
    "\nBut it wasn\u2019t just Page and Strzok, there were FIVE other investigators on the Clinton case who expressed overtly political views in support of Clinton and/or against Trump\u2026 DURING the investigation.",
    "\nPage and Strzok are not the only FBI officials assigned to the Clinton email probe who were found to have exchanged personal messages indicating either an animus against Trump or frustration with the fact that the FBI was investigating Clinton.",
    "\nThe report identified five officials with some connection to the email probe who were expressing political views, faulting them for having brought \u201cdiscredit to themselves, sowed doubt about the FBI\u2019s handling of the midyear investigation, and impacted the reputation of the FBI.\u201d The midyear investigation refers to the Clinton email probe.",
    "\n\u201cThe messages cast a cloud over the FBI investigations to which these employees were assigned,\u201d Horowitz alleged.",
    "\n\u201cUltimately the consequences of these actions impact not only the senders of these messages but also other who worked on these investigation and, indeed, the entire FBI.\u201d\nThe IG also found that the FBI moved slowly on new evidence that could have damned Hillary Clinton, and did so for reasons that make no sense.",
    "\nThe report took particular aim at FBI officials investigating Clinton\u2019s email server for moving slowly after agents in the New York Field office discovered messages on the laptop of disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner that might be relevant to their case.",
    "\nBy no later than September 29, the inspector general alleged, the bureau had learned \u201cvirtually every fact\u201d it would cite as justification late the next month to search Weiner\u2019s laptop for messages of Clinton and top aide Huma Abedin.",
    "\nThe inspector general derided the bureau\u2019s reasons for not moving more quickly \u2014 that agents were waiting for additional information from New York, that they couldn\u2019t move without a warrant and that investigators were more focused on the Russia case \u2014 as \u201cunpersuasive,\u201d \u201cillogical,\u201d and inconsistent with their assertion that they would leave no stone unturned on Clinton.",
    "\nThe report also faulted the bureau for assigning essentially the same personnel to the Russia and Clinton teams, and singled out Strzok, suggesting his anti-Trump views might have played a role in his not acting more expeditiously on the new lead.",
    "\n\u201cUnder these circumstances, we did not have confidence that Strzok\u2019s decision to prioritize the Russia investigation over following up on the Midyear-related investigative lead discovered on the Weiner laptop was free from bias,\u201d the report said.",
    "\nDid you get that?",
    "\nIG Horowitz can\u2019t prove it, but he\u2019s not sure that Strzok wasn\u2019t acting in a politically biased manner when he slow-played the Clinton investigation while moving more quickly on the Russia investigation.",
    "\nHow in the world can we trust them even as they express bias while investigating malfeasance?",
    "\nWe see this kind of corruption all over the world, why should believe that these officials could be immune to acting on their personal biases?",
    "\nThere were 7 of them on the case, and they were comfortable enough with each other to express their biases openly and none of them ever chastised the others for expressing those biases!",
    "\nNot only that, the team that handled Clinton\u2019s investigation so poorly was almost the identical team that was then assigned to handle the Russia investigation!",
    "\nMeaning, the obviously politically biased team that had just cleared the woman that they supported, was now tapped to investigate if the man that they hated was tied to Russian corruption.",
    "\nThis is INSANE.",
    "\nMeanwhile, another story just breaking at Fox News provides even more evidence that Peter Strzok is the big bad guy in the FBI mess.",
    "\nNot only was he slow-playing the Clinton investigation, he may be the only reason she was never charged with a crime.",
    "\nIn a newly released FBI email, we learned that \u201cforeign actors\u201d gained at least some access to Hillary Clinton\u2019s unsecure email system.",
    "\nFox News obtained the memo prepared by the House Judiciary and Oversight committees, which lays out key interim findings ahead of next week\u2019s hearing with Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz.",
    "\nThe IG, separately, is expected to release his highly anticipated report on the Clinton email case later Thursday.",
    "\nThe House committees, which conducted a joint probe into decisions made by the DOJ in 2016 and 2017, addressed a range of issues in their memo including Clinton\u2019s email security.",
    "\n\u201cDocuments provided to the Committees show foreign actors obtained access to some of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails \u2014 including at least one email classified \u2018Secret,'\u201d the memo says, adding that foreign actors also accessed the private accounts of some Clinton staffers.",
    "\nHere\u2019s the email in question:\nPeter Strzok email about Clinton emails by Fox News on Scribd\nThe email came from FBI agent Peter Strzok and it\u2019s the first place we see the question of whether or not Clinton can be found as \u201cgrossly negligent,\u201d in the handling of classified intel.",
    "\nRemember, Strzok is widely credited as the man who changed FBI Director Comey\u2019s language on the Clinton email investigation from the prosecutable \u201cgrossly negligent\u201d to the legally superflous \u201cextremely careless.\u201d\nAt HotAir.com John Sexton explains the importance of this discovery:\nIn the FBI memo, you can already see the genesis of the distinction the FBI would rely on to clear Clinton.",
    "\nStrzok writes that the media has been focused on the question of why Hillary seems to be getting a pass when \u201cPetraeus/Berger/Libby\u201d did not.",
    "\nHe writes, \u201cWe draw the distinction in noting we have no evidence classified information was ever shared with an unauthorized party, i.e.",
    "\nnotwithstanding the server setup, we have not seen classified information shared with a member of the media, an agent of a foreign power, a lover, etc.\u201d In other words, Hillary may have been hacked but she didn\u2019t intentionally give anything away.",
    "\nOf course, the statute itself didn\u2019t make intent a prerequisite.",
    "\nHerridge reports that the House committee memo once again raises this same issue: \u201cOfficials from both agencies have created a perception they misinterpreted the Espionage Act by stating Secretary Clinton lacked the requisite \u2018intent\u2019 for charges to be filed,\u201d the memo says, before pointing to statements by Comey that indicated a belief that intent was required \u2014 which the memo says ignored \u201cmeaningful aspects\u201d of the law.",
    "\nIt really does seem that Strzok, an agent who had a personal pro-Hillary bias, was the person who pushed to let her off the hook by focusing on her intent rather than her negligence setting up the server in the first place.",
    "\nI fully believe IG Horowitz\u2019 findings here.",
    "\nI believe that he was unable to prove that there was any political motive to the FBI\u2019s handling of the Clinton email case, and I believe that while the case was obviously mishandled, it could have reached the conclusion it did honorably.",
    "\nHowever, I also think that the IG has purposely left room in his conclusion to amend that decision after he\u2019s concluded his Russia investigation.",
    "\nIn fact, there are already signs of him doing that in this report.",
    "\nMuch of the information that he uses to chastise Strzok\u2019s behavior and judgment in the Clinton email case, would have actually come from his current investigation into the Russia mess.",
    "\nIt\u2019s quite possible that as bad as this report is for Comey, Strzok, Page, and Obama\u2019s FBI leadership\u2026 Horowitz\u2019 conclusion in the Russia investigation could prove to be even worse.",
    "\nWe\u2019ll see.",

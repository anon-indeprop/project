    "FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre\u2019s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976\n\nOn that occasion Archbishop Lefebvre delivered an address on the desperate state of the Church at that time\u201442 years ago\u2014that was never transcribed or published until we did so for the December 15, 2017 print edition of The Remnant.",
    "\nIt was held at the Radisson South Hotel, Minneapolis, on Tuesday, May 12, 1976, and its stated purpose was to assist the Archbishop in gaining a stronger foothold for the Society of St. Pius X in the States during the unprecedented crisis Blessed Pope Paul had helped unleash on the Church.",
    "\nI\u2019m posting the address here because I'm convinced the Archbishop\u2019s words provide recent recruits to Tradition with vital historical context for the diabolical debacle that is the pontificate of Pope Francis.",
    "\nAnd for those of us who\u2019ve been in the trenches for a long, long time it also provides welcome reminder of why we must continue to fight.",
    "\nEven though I personally was in attendance back in 1976 when Archbishop Lefebvre delivered this address in Minneapolis, I was only ten years old and of course didn't realize how prophetic he was on that occasion, or how devastated by the Second Vatican Council, the New Mass, and the Freemasonic infiltration of the Vatican.",
    "\nIn fact, this transcript reads like a message of encouragement at a crucial moment in the history of this movement\u2014Stay in the fight!",
    "\nKeep the Faith.",
    "\nNever surrender!",
    "\nThis address also makes it absolutely clear that everything Archbishop Lefebvre did was part of an eleventh-hour defence of the Kingship of Christ (ignored completely by the Second Vatican Council) and a desperate last stand for Tradition, the infallible teachings of Mother Church and of course her ancient liturgy.",
    "\nAnd now that Pope Francis has inadvertently unmasked the true spirit of Vatican II, it becomes obvious how and why those who resisted that spirit were right to have done so and will certainly be hailed by history as the heroic band of Catholic brothers that mounted the twentieth century\u2019s last stand for Christ the King and, while scorned and mocked at the time, were nevertheless totally vindicated fifty years later.",
    "\nMay we continue to earn the right to stand with them today.",
    "\nMJM\nThe Archbishop Speaks\nLadies and Gentlemen:\nAs I said to Mr. [Walter] Matt, I can say in bad English what he says in good English, because he said all of the things I want to say [Referring here to Walter Matt\u2019s introductory talk referenced above.]",
    "\nAnd I thank you, Mr. Matt, very much, for his invitation, and I thank you for your coming, and I thank Fr.",
    "\nWard for what he said about the Society of St. Pius X.",
    "\nAnd I hope that you can understand my poor English, but I think it is better to speak some bad English because to translate would take too much time.",
    "\nAs Mr. Matt said, the crisis in the Church is very extraordinary.",
    "\nIt is very difficult to understand the situation today.",
    "\nMy seminary in Econe (in Switzerland) and the seminaries in Germany and here in America, in Armada, are in very difficult situations with Rome.",
    "\nWhy?",
    "\nThese seminaries are the same as seminaries were before the Second Vatican Council.",
    "\nThey have the same discipline and the same studies, they make good priests; I think they are good seminarians.",
    "\nAll is done as all the seminaries before the Second Vatican Council.",
    "\nWhy are we now in this very sad situation with Rome?",
    "\nI think that because in the Second Vatican Council, and after the Council, there is a mutation, a change, in the Church.",
    "\nBut we do not change.",
    "\nWe continue the Tradition.",
    "\nSo why do they now say, as Mgr.",
    "\n(Archbishop) Benelli[1] said to me months ago on the 19th of March, \u201cyou are out of communion with the Church.\u201d I am out of communion with the Church because I continue the Tradition of the Church?",
    "\nThis is possible?",
    "\nI do not understand.",
    "\nWhy?",
    "\nI have done nothing.",
    "\nI believe nothing other than what the Church has believed for twenty centuries.",
    "\nMgr.",
    "\nBenelli then said to me, you must put down in a writing to the Holy Father that you accept the Second Vatican Council, you accept the reform that followed the Council, and that you accept the orientations that have been given by Rome.",
    "\nMgr.",
    "\nBenelli took the book of the New Ordo, gave it to me, and said, \u201cYou must say this New Mass in all of your houses.\u201d\nI wonder why Mgr.",
    "\nBenelli did not communicate this condition to me before our meeting.",
    "\n[2] He could have done so.",
    "\nFor example, one year ago three cardinals sent me a letter (Cardinals Wright, Tabera [Arturo Carinal Tabera Araoz, one of the Council Fathers MJM], and Gabriel-Marie Garrone) telling me (in effect) that I must close the seminaries.",
    "\nWell, I refused, because I refuse to contribute to the destruction of the Church.",
    "\nBecause now they are destroying the Church.",
    "\nWhen I die and go before the judge, God will not be able to say to me, \u201cYou destroyed the Church.\u201d I refused to contribute to the destruction of the Church.",
    "\nI am sure that my seminaries are contributing to the restoration of the Church.",
    "\nI do not destroy the Church.",
    "\nAnd so I said to Mgr.",
    "\nBenelli, \u201cNo, I will not sign that writing.\u201d\nI think that the mutation in the Church came in through the Second Vatican Council.",
    "\nAnd do you think this change in the Church came suddenly?",
    "\nWhen, then?",
    "\nAt the beginning of the Council?",
    "\nNo, this change in the Church began one century before [the Council].",
    "\nPope Pius VI said during the French Revolution that if the Church continues to remain under the influence of the prince of the revolution, then, in the future a crisis will come upon the Church.",
    "\nIn [1844], Pope Pius IX ordered Cardinal Rigoli to publish the Instructions of the Carbonari.",
    "\n[3] The Pope himself asked Cardinal Rigoli to publish the Instructions of the Carbonari.",
    "\nAnd what did these Instructions say?",
    "\nThe Instructions said that they [the Carbonari/Freemasons] must begin to fight against the Church by bringing reform into the Church.",
    "\nThe Instructions said the infiltration will take perhaps not one year, perhaps not ten years, but perhaps a century.",
    "\nThe Carbonari must enter into the seminary, into the convent, into the sacristy, and slowly, very slowly, the priests will have the ideals of the revolution; of the Freemasons.",
    "\nOne day these priests, imbued with Masonic principles, will become bishops, and these bishops can then choose a pope.",
    "\nAnd even if the pope is not a Freemason, he will have the same ideals as the Freemasons.",
    "\nPope Pius IX called for the publishing of these Instructions in order to warn the bishops and priests of those times of the fight against the church.",
    "\nIn 1895, the Catholic Antonia Fogazzaro, a known modernist, founded a masonic lodge in Milan.",
    "\nHe wrote in his book, Il Santo, that \u201cWe [modernists]\u2026want a reform in the Church\u2026without rebellion, carried out by legitimate authority\u2026even if this takes 20, 30, or 50 years.\u201d[4] \u201cThe reform will have to be brought about in the name of obedience.\u201d The modernist ideas in the Church introduced and enacted through obedience!",
    "\nAnd I think\u2026well, here we are!",
    "\nIn this time!",
    "\nThe reform is here, and it is brought about through obedience, to the Council, to the bishop, to the priest.",
    "\nAnd all they say is \u201cObedience, obedience, obedience.\u201d\nThe Instructions of the Carbonari say the bishop and the priest will think that they are following the tiara of the Pope, but they will be following the flag of Freemasonry [\u201cthe banner of revolution\u201d].",
    "\nThey said that.",
    "\nThey wrote that!",
    "\nOne century before [the Council]!",
    "\nThus, it is very important to know that they prepared for the beginning of the Second Vatican Council for a century, perhaps two centuries!",
    "\nAs the Archbishop of Dakar and President of the Episcopal Commission for French-speaking West Africa, I was appointed member of the Central Preparatory Commission of the Second Vatican Council.",
    "\nThere were some seventy cardinals, twenty bishops, and four super-authorities of the religious orders, among others.",
    "\nBefore the last meeting of this Commission the members received two schemas on the same subject: one from Cardinal Ottaviani and another from Cardinal Bea.",
    "\nThe schema from Cardinal Ottaviani was titled \u201c\u2026On Religious Tolerance\u201d and the other, from Cardinal Bea, was titled \u201cOn Religious Freedom [Liberty].\u201d When we read these two schemas, we thought, \u201cThis is impossible.",
    "\nHow is it we can receive two opposing theses?",
    "\nOne says we must not tolerate error.",
    "\nThe other says that error has the right to exist in the name of the dignity of the human person.\u201d And so, we go into the meeting.",
    "\nCardinal Ottaviani, standing, says to Cardinal Bea, \u201cYou have no authority to compose this schema, because it is a theological thesis and therefore within the competence of the Theological Commission.\u201d As Cardinal Bea stands up, he says, \u201cI do have the right to compose this schema because if anything concerns Christian Unity it is religious liberty, and I am the President of the Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity.\u201d Cardinal Bea, addressing Cardinal Ottaviani, further said, \u201cI am opposed to your schema.\u201d\nImpossible!",
    "\nWe were in a very sad, serious situation.",
    "\nCardinal Ruffini had to intervene as we were in front of two cardinals, our brothers.",
    "\nHe said we must wait for the authority to say who is right and who is wrong.",
    "\nBut before the Pope came (because the Pope came many times to present at these meetings) we voted on the schema.",
    "\nWho is with Cardinal Ottaviani?",
    "\nWho is with Cardinal Bea?",
    "\nThe conservatives and the liberals.",
    "\nAs the last meeting of the Preparatory Commission, it was for me the first image of the future Council.",
    "\nThis historic address appeared for the first time ever in a print edition of The Remnant last year.",
    "\nIsn't it time for you to subscribe?",
    "\nAnd as we go into the Council, you know that on the first day of the Council, Cardinal Lienart was the chief of the liberal cardinals in the Council, [together] with all of the Cardinals of the Rhine (such as Cardinal Alfrink, Cardinal Frings, Cardinal Dopfner, Cardinal Suenens, Cardinal Leinart, and Cardinal Koenig of Austria).",
    "\nAnd now one month ago in Rome, the traditional periodical Chiesa Viva published a photo of Cardinal Lienart with all of the appurtenances of Freemasonry, the date of his inscription in Masonry, the date [of his rising to] the 20th Degree of Freemasonry, the date [of his rising to] the 30th Degree of Freemasonry, and the places where he [attended] the meetings of Freemasonry.",
    "\nThis Cardinal was the chief of the liberals in the Council.",
    "\nThat is my cardinal; he ordained me to the priesthood, and he consecrated me a bishop.",
    "\nAnd now this is public.",
    "\nNobody has been able to refute the publication.",
    "\nAnd so, we have (I am confident) a mutation in the church by the Council and by the reform after the Council.",
    "\nNow, some say the Council is (was) good, but only the reforms were bad.",
    "\nThat is not true.",

    "\nI am a Catholic, I shall remain Catholic, and I do everything possible for the Council and the Catholics in our country.\u201d\nThen, the discourse of the Nuncio was the discourse of a Freemason: all of it was \u201cprogress,\u201d \u201chumanity,\u201d \u201cevolution,\u201d and all the hubris of a Freemason.",
    "\nAnd during the discourse of the Secretary of the Episcopal Conference, [the Secretary] said, \u201cin the name of the Declaration of Religious Freedom [of Vatican II], we ask the President to remove this article in the Constitution.\u201d\nI met this Secretary of the Episcopal Conference during my visit in Columbia, and he said for two years they [had been asking] the President, in the name of the Holy See, to change this article in their Constitution.",

    "\nWe need the authority of God.",

    "A Sister Speaks: \u2018Cor Orans is the Death-Knell of Carmel\u2019\n\nUnder the first part of my ongoing analysis of \u201cCor orans,\u201d a commenter wrote: \u201cWhen the enemy wants to take a soul, he tries to make it give up prayer.\u201d\nThe Vatican presents a choice: the world, or Christ.",
    "\n\u201cThe Prologue [of the Rule of St. Benedict] set this choice before us, the world or Our Lord, as mutually exclusive alternatives; we cannot remain neutral, but must belong wholly to the one or wholly to the other.\u201d\nDom Paul Delatte, OSB, Abbot of Solesmes\nToday I received an email from a monastery of cloistered Carmelite nuns about the new document from the Vatican\u2019s Congregation for Religious.",
    "\nThey\u2019re helping me examine this document, having kindly volunteered to serve as consultants, to help me understand it from an inside position.",
    "\nThese, I might add, are not what we would consider a \u201ctraditionalist\u201d community.",
    "\nThey have only the Novus Ordo Mass and use the new rite Divine Office in their native vernacular language.",
    "\nFor obvious reasons I can\u2019t identify them, even to say what country they are in.",
    "\nWriting to me in English, by way of introductory comments in their longer analysis of the document that will be forthcoming, Sister T, fully professed and a senior member of the monastery\u2019s council, said, \u201cThe Cor Orans document is the death-knell of Carmel.",
    "\nIt signals the end of the contemplative monastic life.",
    "\nNot only does it destroy the autonomy of the Monasteries, something Our Holy Mother St. Teresa was extremely insistent about, but it also removes the Superior, dissolves her authority and power, removes the financial independence of each Monastery, and destroys the specificity of each charism.",
    "\n\u201cThis is a disaster.",
    "\nEspecially for Carmel.\u201d\nI contrast this frightening comment with those coming from the man immediately responsible for \u201cCor orans,\u201d Cardinal Jo\u00e3o Braz de Aviz, the Brazilian prefect of the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life in a speech to religious formation directors in 2015, in which he laid out pretty clearly what was coming in this piece of legislation, 3 years later.",
    "\nIn fact, as the National Catholic Reporter piece said, the meeting itself was \u201cunprecedented,\u201d 1200 formators of religious life gathered by the Congregation for Religious in order to hear the new marching orders.",
    "\nThis is the programme:\n\u201cDo not distance yourself from the great lines of the Second Vatican Council.\u201d \u201cIn fact, those that are distancing themselves from the council to make another path are killing themselves \u2013 sooner or later, they will die.",
    "\nThey will not have sense.",
    "\nThey will be outside the church.",
    "\nWe need to build, using the Gospel and the Council as a departure point.\u201d\nAfter breathing this threat, the cardinal continued, saying that because modern people\u2019s \u201cneeds\u201d are fundamentally different from what they were in the past, there was no reason to stick too closely to what the founders and foundresses \u2013 people like St. Anthony, St. Augustine, St. John Cassian, St. Benedict, St. Bruno, St. Dominic, Sts.",
    "\nFrancis and Clare, Sts.",
    "\nTeresa of Avila and John of the Cross - wanted.",
    "\n\u201cThese contexts have changed.",
    "\nAnd the council reminds us that consecrated life must be Christian discipleship ... must be discipleship of the founders that we remember, but also must be open to the culture of the present moment.\u201d\n\u201cWe must not be closed to new things.",
    "\nGod is not static,\u201d the cardinal said.",
    "\n\u201cGod is always new movement \u2013 of light, of heat, of demonstration.",
    "\nHe speaks in every time to men and women with the true language of that time.\u201d\nThe congregation\u2019s Secretary, Archbishop Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez Carballo, is reported as saying, \u201cWith this explicit reference to the Second Vatican Council, we point to our profound conviction that the council is the point of reference, non-negotiable, in the formation to the consecrated life.\u201d\nNot the charism of the order, nor the rule, nor the Patristic tradition, nor the Doctors, nor the mystics, nor any of the 2000-year-old tradition of religious life, from the Desert Fathers to the giants of the Tridentine period; just Vatican II.",
    "\nAnd only, apparently, a single \u201cinterpretation\u201d of it, if we are to judge by the soap and oil Braz de Aviz poured on the ruffled feathers of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious \u2013 the most virulently anti-Catholic organisation of \u201cCatholic\u201d religious in the world \u2013 and by his vicious persecution of the Franciscans of the Immaculate.",
    "\nCarballo continues his remarks, giving us a clue as to his feelings towards strictly cloistered, contemplative religious life: \u201cA consecrated life, a life in God but inserted in the ecclesial family, in the church \u2013 inserted in the world.",
    "\nNot in conflict with the world, but inserted in continuity,\u201d he said.",
    "\nIt is to wonder what this man would make of a comment by the great Dom Paul Delatte, the second abbot of Solesmes and successor to the refounder, Dom Gueranger, who wrote in his commentary on the Rule of St. Benedict:\n\u201cThe Prologue set this choice before us, the world or Our Lord, as mutually exclusive alternatives; we cannot remain neutral, but must belong wholly to the one or wholly to the other.\u201d\n\u201cAfter entering into Christ by baptism and by the monastic profession, we should hold ourselves as far aloof from the world as possible and have no connection with it.",
    "\nThere shall no longer be more intercourse between us than there is between two corpses: \u2018The world is crucified to me and I to the world.\u2019\n\u201cLet us be on our guard against thinking that it may sometimes be proper to soften the differences, to lessen the distance which separates us.",
    "\nThe Apostle warns us that we can only please God by preserving the integrity of our true life: \u2018No man being a soldier to God, entangleth himself with secular businesses: that he may please him to whom he hath engaged himself.\u2019 The world itself is scandalised by our condescending to it, and the words of the Imitation [of Christ] are always fulfilled: \u2018Sometimes we think to please others by our company; whereas we begin rather to be displeasing to them by reason of the bad qualities they discover in us.\u2019\u201d\nHow Cor orans will end St. Teresa of Avila\u2019s reform of Carmel\nSister T. continued, saying that the document explicitly derogates the founding intentions of St. Teresa for whom real autonomy was a crucial element of her Carmelite reform.",
    "\nShe acknowledges that cloistered orders of nuns have for some time been gathered into federations.",
    "\nThese are already doing the Cor orans programme, having shared initial formation programmes for postulants and novices, \u201congoing formation\u201d courses for professed nuns, a federal abbess or president who oversees all the federated monasteries.",
    "\nTheir funds are already interconnected and they have regular meetings with and input from the male branches.",
    "\nIn 2015, Carmelite monasteries received a questionnaire from the Father General Fr.",
    "\nSaverio Cannistra, a Mexican and devotee of Liberation Theology, to ask if they wanted an International Commission of Nuns to oversee the female houses place of the Carmelite Fathers.",
    "\nThis suggestion was rejected, to the annoyance of Maccise.",
    "\nMaccise also promoted the idea of having no superiors in the individual monasteries, but only federation presidents and shared formation of novices.",
    "\nThe push for these changes is still on, however, under the current General, an Italian, Saverio Cannistr\u00e0.",
    "\nGiven the Marxist leanings of the recent crop of Fathers General, it seems clear that what can be expected by \u201congoing formation\u201d is, in essence, some form of political indoctrination, sprayed over with a micro-thin layer of pious language.",
    "\nBut for Carmelite nuns, Sister said, these ideas are the antithesis of the intentions of St. Teresa.",
    "\nAuthentic autonomy, independence of formation and finances, \u201care essential points of our charism that Our Holy Mother established and to do away with them is to do away with the charism.\u201d\n\u201cThey go against our Constitutions, even though Cor Orans states that everything is to be done in accord with the charism and Constitutions.",
    "\nEach Carmel has its own spirit, its own tempo, it\u2019s own \u2018feel.\u2019 Each nun is called not just to the Order, but to a specific Carmel.",
    "\nFormation in common is something we\u2019ve been fighting against for years.\u201d\n\u201cTo have a federal president who can decide to take the novices away, or take all our finances, or tell the Holy See we\u2019re no longer \u2018viable\u2019 \u2013 this is a disaster.",
    "\nSt. Teresa specifically set up the monasteries so that none of this would take place.",
    "\nAnd now it\u2019s going to be done to us.\u201d\nShe points to the extended length of formation for new nuns - previously six years for Carmelites and under Cor orans now nine years, as absurd, saying it will tend to impede new vocations.",
    "\n\u201cAs though the Church is going to ask laypeople to be engaged for nine years before they marry.",
    "\nOur Constitutions already provide a three year extension of temporary vows if needed, but to make it mandatory will dissuade women from entering.",
    "\nIt will also help the monastery become \u2018less viable\u2019 because by the time anyone younger is professed, the others will be dead.\u201d\nAnother requirement will be for a \u201creligious assistant,\u201d a priest monitoring the monastery in addition to a chaplain, to be assigned by the federation.",
    "\nSister writes that this was rejected \u201cyears ago\u201d by Carmelite monasteries as undue interference.",
    "\nThe religious assistant will have unprecedented powers.",
    "\nArticle 23 states, for instance, \u201cIn discerning the foundation of a new monastery on the part of a single monastery, the Federal President and the religious assistant intervene to help the superior of the founding monastery.",
    "\nThe discernment on the foundation of a new monastery by the Federation is made within the framework of the Federal Assembly.\u201d\n\u201cOne other thing that is very striking to me is the complete loss of our rights.",
    "\nThere are no options in this document, no choices, no recourse.",
    "\nIt\u2019s all being done to us.",
    "\nIn this day and age, when Pope Francis is proclaiming, if not Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, then at least license and \u2018choice\u2019 for all, plus the \u2018rights\u2019 of women, here our rights are completely taken away.\u201d\nAnother nun has written saying that they cannot conceive of what these people mean by \u201congoing formation\u201d.",
    "\nJudging from other documents from already-federated Carmelites in Europe, it means in practical terms going in groups away from the monastery for days or weeks at a time to take \u201ccourses\u201d together with novices from other monasteries.",
    "\nThe content of these course, of course, is to be formulated by teams of \u201cexperts\u201d chosen by the Federation.",
    "\nSister writes, \u201cCloistered nuns have a very full horarium that does not allow for a lot of other things.",
    "\nWe already have to deal with the million unexpected things that come up each day.",
    "\nI have no idea how we are going to implement all these ridiculous plans of \u2018on-going formation\u2019.",
    "\nCan they not comprehend that simply faithfully living our daily life provides plenty of on-going formation.\u201d\nApparently not.",
    "\nAs I wrote in my first analysis piece, the document itself \u2013 that we must remember is a piece of legislation, a legal document laying out what all monasteries of contemplative nuns must now do \u2013 starts by laying out its working premise:\nPope Francis, in the wake of the teaching of Pope Pius XII and reaffirmed by Ecumenical Vatican Council II, intended to present in Vultum Dei quaerere the intense and fruitful path taken by the Church in the last decades, in the light of the teachings of the same Council and considering the changed socio-cultural conditions.",
    "\nIn other words, it is the \u201cintense and fruitful path\u201d of the last few decades of the Church since Vatican II that all monasteries of cloistered, contemplative nuns must now take.",
    "\nAnyone who imagines that this document\u2019s authors will allow leeway, that there will be dispensations forthcoming for traditional or \u201cconservative\u201d communities from timid and cowed Vatican bodies like Ecclesia Dei, has failed to pay attention.",
    "\nIn the last 20 years, \u201cconservative\u201d Catholics have pointed to the flourishing \u2013 mainly in the US \u2013 of some groups of sisters who had turned away from the \u201cintense and fruitful path\u201d and re-established some of the traditional accoutrements of the religious life.",
    "\nThey point to the Nashville Dominicans, the Missionaries of Charity, the Poor Clares of Alabama, where there are at least habits, (some) chant, common life and common apostolates.",
    "\nBut it is these signs of refusal of the programme that have infuriated the despots of the New Paradigm who would not rest until every last individual house of religious life was co-opted, subverted to the new ideology.",
    "\nThe little green shoots of hope that the faithful Catholic world so rejoiced to see are to be stamped back into the frost of Vatican II\u2019s perpetual winter.",
    "\nIn the continuing analysis that will follow this article, we can see that the purpose of this document is to fulfill the totalitarian fantasies of the anti-Catholic revolutionaries, now nearing the end of their lives 50 years after their initial near-triumph.",
    "\nIts intention is mopping up; either to herd the remaining recalcitrants \u2013 those who have resisted even to the softened and conciliating degrees typical of \u201cconservatives\u201d \u2013 into the full post-conciliar \u201creform\u201d instituted by the revolutionaries in the 1960s \u2013 or to close them.",
    "\nThe thing is, the result will obviously be the same either way.",
    "\nThe whole world has seen what happens to religious life that takes on the VaticanTwoist New Paradigm.",
    "\nI have just received a document that was issued privately summarising the findings of a meeting of federated Discalced Carmelite nuns in Europe in 2009.",
    "\nThe numbers are absolutely dismal.",
    "\nFederation: Belgium\nnumber of convents: 11 Number of nuns: 120\nsolemnly professed: 119\nin formation: 1 average age: 73\nFederation: Belgium - Luxembourg.",
    "\nnumber of convents: 11 number of nuns: 122\nsolemnly professed: 117\nin formation: 5\naverage age: 75\nFederation: Germany number of convents: 14 number of nuns: 178\nsolemnly professed: 170\nin formation: 8\naverage age: 66\nThe rest are similar, and I\u2019ll be analysing this document in some detail in the next piece in this series, but the rest of the responses to the Father General\u2019s questionnaire tell a similar story.",
    "\nThe German federation gave a summary of the efforts made to address these issues.",
    "\n\u201cPath taken: For 15 years they have organized formation courses: on-going & initial formation, and for formators.",
    "\nMeetings for prioresses.",
    "\nPresent Problems: Have got very old.",
    "\nSome sisters are in care-homes run by Franciscans.",
    "\nPossible Solutions: Two convents intend to amalgamate.\u201d\nThis is the death spiral.",
    "\nAnd it is precisely this \u201cintense and fruitful path\u201d taken by nearly all the Catholic world\u2019s monastics since 1965 that Cor orans is attempting to force on the very, very few holdouts."

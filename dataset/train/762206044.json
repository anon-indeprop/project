    "\nThe dispute came after Awan\u2019s father was charged with fraud in relation to the deal, and the mysterious exertion of political influence resulted in Pakistani authorities instead targeting the elderly alleged victims, according to a local report.",
    "\nAnd when a House Office of Inspector General cybersecurity investigation found that Awan made \u201cunauthorized access\u201d to House servers, including the House Democratic Caucus\u2019 shortly before the election, Wasserman Schultz became \u201cfrantic, not normal,\u201d \u201cmaking the rounds\u201d to House officials in an attempt to kill the investigation, one House employee told The Daily Caller News Foundation.",
    "\nAwan told people Wasserman Schultz chose the name for his daughter, Leza \u2014 a Jewish name \u2014 and that the Florida congresswoman\u2019s daughter regularly rode a horse that Awan kept at a boarding facility, sources with knowledge of the relationship told TheDCNF.",

    "\nImran Awan also goes by Shahid Imran Awan, Virginia court records show.",
    "\nThe police harassed the 19 would-be victims, including the five elderly brothers and even their lawyer, and charged them with \u201cfrivolous\u201d cases, apparently to get them to stop trying to get the money they say they were owed, the paper said.",
    "\n\u201cMohammad Abid, a victim of [Ashraf] Awan\u2019s alleged high-profile swindling, said that [Ashraf] Awan\u2019s son had easy access to the corridors of power and that\u2019s why he was able to [pressure] the police to dance to his tunes,\u201d Dawn reported.",
    "\nThe article details a series of people who say they were then subject to retaliation, including widow Bushra Bibi who said, \u201cnow Imran was threatening her with dire consequences.\u201d\nA third source, who\u2019s familiar with Imran Awan, told TheDCNF that Awan recounted the intervention in the foreign criminal matter and that Awan said it was Wasserman Schultz who intervened.",
    "\nA fourth source \u2014 a fellow House IT aide \u2014 previously told TheDCNF that Awan said now-Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel wasinvolved.",
    "\nDr. Zafar Iqbal, one of the alleged victims, told TheDCNF that \u201cImran came to Pakistan to get [his father] out of jail, since he had some [connections] in the Congress.\u201d\nAshraf Awan\u2019s business partner in the land deal, Rashid Minhas, told TheDCNF that the elder Awan gave a USB to a Pakistani senator who is a former head of a Pakistani intelligence agency, and that Imran claimed his IT position in Congress gave him the power to \u201cchange the U.S. president.\u201d Minhas is in prison for an unrelated fraud charge.",
    "\nOn July 25, 2016, the House Inspector General notified the Committee on House Administration that investigators had detected major cybersecurity violations by the Awan family.",
    "\nAwan, his wife, two brothers, his brother\u2019s wife, and even his elderly father were all being paid by various Democrats to manage their servers, with many of the members from Wasserman Schultz\u2019s Florida.",
    "\nThe finding came at a critical time for Democrats: It was three days after WikiLeaks published the first emails from a hacked on the DNC, setting the stage for Wasserman Schultz to lose her position as party chair and for Democrats to begin electioneering on a theme of Russian hacking.",
    "\nIn February 2017, Kiko and the House\u2019s top law enforcement official, Paul Irving, outlined serious violations in a letter to the committee, and the family was banned from the House computer network.",
    "\nThe letter also noted that the House Democratic Caucus server disappeared soon after the IG report named it as key evidence.",
    "\nBut Wasserman Schultz refused to fire Awan, with her spokesman saying he would work on \u201cwebsites\u201d and \u201cprinters,\u201d which a cybersecurity expert previously told TheDCNF would presumably involve network access.",
    "\nThe congresswoman also added Awan\u2019s wife, Hina Alvi, to her payroll in late 2016, after the investigation was in full swing, but before the family was banned from the network.",
    "\nWasserman Schultz kept paying her until March 17 \u2014 12 days after Alvi went to Pakistan with $12,000 in a suitcase.",
    "\nHer actions so rattled the Administration Committee\u2019s Democratic staff director, Jamie Fleet, that he planted a negative story in Politico that revealed Wasserman Schultz, his fellow Democrat, was continuing to pay the suspect, two House sources said.",
    "\nThe story also said Wasserman Schultz had a \u201cfriendly personal relationship\u201d with Awan and Alvi.",
    "\nFleet did not respond to a request for comment.",
    "\nKiko said in an April 2018 hearing spurred by the scandal that he was powerless to stop members who refused to fire a bad actor.",
    "\n\u201cTermination, now it\u2019s the member\u2019s responsibility \u2026 We can revoke everything but they could still be employed,\u201d he said.",
    "\nHe added that his office should have the authority to override members who would want to keep a rule-breaker on the government network.",
    "\nWasserman Schultz became fixated on finding out everything investigators knew about Awan, the House sources said.",
    "\nHouse investigators briefed her extensively with significant evidence about Awan and his family, including improper computer evidence.",
    "\nYet Wasserman Schultz said in a statement, \u201cmy office was provided no evidence to indicate that laws had been broken, which over time, raised troubling concerns about due process, fair treatment and potential ethnic and religious profiling.\u201d\nWasserman Schultz was defending someone investigators allegedly told her was suspected of cybersecurity violations, despite having resigned from her position as DNC head following a devastating hack during the 2016 election.",
    "\nDespite Wasserman Schultz\u2019s relationship with Awan, in April 2017 \u2014 two months after he was banned from the computer network \u2014 the IT aide appeared to put the congresswoman at risk.",
    "\nCapitol Police found a laptop with the username RepDWS in a phone booth at midnight along with a copy of Awan\u2019s ID, a letter to prosecutors and a note that said \u201cattorney client privilege,\u201d according to a police report.",
    "\nAwan\u2019s ID caused police to tie it to a criminal suspect and seize it, but the note kept them from looking at it.",
    "\nThat led to a tense exchange recorded on video in May 2017, in which Wasserman Schultz threatened the chief of the Capitol Police with \u201cconsequences\u201d for not returning the laptop.",
    "\nWhen he refused, she mulled attempting to restructuring the Capitol Police\u2019s entire board so that her committee would have more leverage over it.",
    "\nHouse sources told TheDCNF these exchanges were only a public glimpse into numerous such interactions, which were frequently profane, with every official she could buttonhole.",
    "\nOne source said she also went to the Department of Justice and \u201cmade a stink.\u201d\nWasserman Schultz hired the House\u2019s former top lawyer, Bill Pittard \u2014 who had recently quit the House \u2014 to try to block prosecutors from seeing evidence, TheDCNF previously reported.Awan obtained legal representation from two lawyers who began their careers in Miami \u2014 one with experience in espionage cases and the other a former aide to Hillary Clinton.",
    "\nWasserman Schultz\u2019 district includes much of Miami.",
    "\nOne of Awan\u2019s lawyers told a judge he felt \u201cvery strongly\u201d that prosecutors should not be able to look at the RepDWS laptop, mounting an attorney-client privilege argument.",
    "\nProsecutors did not challenge the argument before the judge.",
    "\nIn August 2017, Imran and Hina were charged with four felony counts for gathering up money under allegedly false circumstances before wiring $300,000 to Pakistan in January.",
    "\nProsecutors said the timing suggests that the Awans had learned of their investigation, which a spokeswoman for Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, AshLee Strong, told TheDCNF was supposed to be secret.",
    "\nCapitol Police \u201crequested that the shared employees be allowed to continue to use their IT credentials until February [2017] because they didn\u2019t want to tip off the employees,\u201d she said.",
    "\nWasserman Schultz\u2019s brother is a prosecutor in the same office handling the case and has tweeted about it.",
    "\nGowen said the wire transfer instead had to do with the land deal, which he told the Washington Examiner was \u201cquickly souring.\u201d\nWasserman Schultz did not respond to a request for comment."

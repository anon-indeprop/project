    "Hungarian Prime Minister Hits Nail On The Head: Refugees Are Actually \"Muslim Invaders\"\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban doesn't mince words when it comes to the Muslim invasion in Europe and specifically to his own country.",
    "\nOrban says there is not only Muslim invaders in the mix of \"refugees,\" but also \u201ceconomic migrants\" seeking better lives for themselves.",
    "\nIndeed, both of these are true.",
    "\nThere are plenty of these people who are simply happy to have a place to live after many were driven from their homes due to the US, Russia and other countries putting their noses where they didn't belong and funding, training and arming Islamic jihadis there.",
    "\nThen, there are those who clearly come to the country to Islamasize the country because they have an Islamic dominionist attitude borne of the teachings of the Koran and Muhammad .",
    "\nRT reports:\nRefugees in Europe are just \u201cMuslim invaders\u201d and economic migrants seeking better lives, Hungarian PM Viktor Orban has said, adding that the large number of Muslims in the EU had led to the appearance of \u2018parallel societies.\u2019 Asked in an interview with the German Bild newspaper why Budapest does not want to accept any refugees, Orban replied: \u201cWe don\u2019t consider these people to be Muslim refugees.\u201d Instead, the tough-talking politician said they were regarded as \u201cMuslim invaders.\u201d Asylum seekers must cross four countries to reach Hungary from Syria, all of which are not as rich as Germany but are economically stable, the PM said.",
    "\nHe was apparently referring to Turkey, Greece, Macedonia and Serbia \u2013 a common route for migrants heading for \u2018wealthy\u2019 Europe.",
    "\n\u201cSo, they are not running for their lives [in these countries].",
    "\nThey are merely economic migrants seeking a better life,\u201d Orban concluded.",
    "\nHe stressed though, that he can only speak for the Hungarians and they \u201cdon\u2019t want\u201d immigration.",
    "\nIn his view, the government simply can\u2019t go against the will of the people.",
    "\nAnd Orban has stayed the course, too while governments like that of Germany have ignored their people to allow for a clear invasion of Germany that has led to untold numbers of sexual assaults by Muslim migrants, attacks on Christians and there's no telling the amount of damage to the unethical welfare system in the country.",
    "\nRT continues:\nGoing further, the prime minister noted that no refugee wants to go to Portugal, for example, adding that the majority of asylum seekers simply wanted to live in prosperous Germany.",
    "\n\u201cThe reason why people are in your country is not because they are refugees, but because they want a German life,\u201d he said, describing the issue \u201cpolitically\u201d as a European problem but, \u201csociologically,\u201d as a German problem.",
    "\nOrban specifically targeted Germany and Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s \u2018open-door\u2019 policy towards asylum seekers.",
    "\n\u201cI\u2019ve never understood how chaos, anarchy and illegal border crossings are viewed as something good in a country like Germany, which we view as the best example of discipline and the rule of law,\u201d he said.",
    "\nThe recent wave of refugees reaching Europe is merely an invasion, according to Orban.",
    "\n\u201cIf someone wants to come to your house, he knocks on your door and asks: \u2018Can we come in, can we stay?\u2019 They [asylum seekers] didn\u2019t do that, they crossed the border illegally,\u201d he stated.",
    "\nOrban then did what most political representatives will simply not do, he told the truth about multiculturalism.",
    "\nHe called it an \"illusion\" and said that Christian and Muslim societies \u201cwill never unite.\u201d\nOf course, they won't.",
    "\nThey have absolutely nothing in common.",
    "\nThey cannot agree on God's law, which most Western societies were base on, including the united States.",
    "\nThey cannot agree on the Scriptures.",
    "\nThey cannot agree on the person and work of Jesus the Christ.",
    "\nThey can't even agree on the means of proselytizing and of what real spiritual weapons are.",
    "\nPM Orban has remained consistent.",
    "\nHe has publicly told the Muslim invaders to leave Hungary and never come back.",
    "\nHe has rebuffed Brussels, which is largely Islamic, and told them that Hungary would defend its borders, and it has.",
    "\nOrban's border wall reduced illegal immigration by 99%!",
    "\nHe has genuinely reached out his hand to help Christian migrants instead of Muslim migrants and he seems to be one that holds to the Christian faith, as emulated by the Protestant Reformers, saying, \"That which serves the glory of God is the best for the people.\"",
    "\nFurthermore, Orban has also called out the man behind the curtain in a lot of the promoting of this Muslim invasion of the West, George Soros.",
    "\nAnti-jihadist activist Pamela Geller praised Orban for his honesty and wrote, \"At last, a politician who speaks the truth about the Muslim invasion of Europe.",
    "\nAnd while Orban is right that these are 'economic migrants,' they are also 'Muslim invaders.'\"",
    "\n\"They don\u2019t want a 'German life' in Germany in the sense that they are willing to accept German values,\" she added.",
    "\n\"Many, all too many, of them want to overwhelm German values, and European values in general, with sharia values.",
    "\nThey are in Europe to conquer and Islamize it, with willing and eager help from Europe\u2019s short-sighted, self-serving, internationalist intelligentsia.\"",
    "\nIndeed!",
    "\nThank you Prime Minister Orban for saying what needed to be said!"

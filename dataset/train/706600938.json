    "\n\"St. Francis in Ecstacy\", Caravaggio, 1595\nSaint Francis\u2019 prophecy is clearly not a prediction of the Great Western Schism (1378-1417), which did not involve a \u201cdestroyer\u201d on the Chair of Peter who leads the faithful into error, widespread apostasy, and the persecution of faithful Catholics as \u201cschismatics.\u201d But it does contain elements very familiar to us today.",
    "\nAnd what inference might one draw from the coincidence that Saint Francis\u2019 prophecy of a future \u201cdestroyer\u201d in the papal office seems to correspond rather well with the pontificate of the only Pope who has taken Francis\u2019 name as his own?",
    "\n\nSomething else to consider: Saint Francis, one of the greatest saints in Church history, one of the few who is known and revered by the whole world, freely revealed his vision of an ecclesial destroyer who usurps the papal office.",
    "\nThat is, Saint Francis did not suffer from the currently reigning papolatry, which holds that the indefectibility of the Church depends upon defending every word and deed of a given Pope as somehow consistent with Tradition and declares absolutely inadmissible the idea that the holder of the Petrine office could be a threat to the integrity of the Faith.",
    "\nRather, Saint Francis, illuminated by heaven itself, recognized the coming reality of what Saint Robert Bellarmine, a Doctor of the Church, hypothesized as possible in principle, to cite another \u201capocryphal\u201d quotation:\nJust as it is licit to resist the Pontiff that aggresses the body, it is also licit to resist the one who aggresses souls or who disturbs civil order, or, above all, who attempts to destroy the Church.",

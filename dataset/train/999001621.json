    "\nThat seems to have become its main purpose.",
    "\nAs Disobediant Media notes (emphasis in the original):\nWhile most readers with functional critical thinking capacity may readily dismiss the Guardian\u2019s smear on its face, the fact that the Guardian published this piece, and that Luke Harding is still operating with even the tiniest modicum of respect as a journalist despite his history of deceit, tells us something bone-chilling about journalism.",
    "\nIt is no accident that Luke Harding is still employed: in fact, it is because of Harding\u2019s consistent loyalty to establishment, specifically the UK intelligence apparatus, over the truth that determines his \u201csuccess\u201d amongst legacy press outlets.",
    "\nHarding is not a defacement or a departure from the norm, but the personification of it.",
    "\nJonathan Cook, a former Guardian writer, makes a similar point:\nThe truth is that the Guardian has not erred in this latest story attacking Assange, or in its much longer-running campaign to vilify him.",
    "\nWith this story, it has done what it regularly does when supposedly vital western foreign policy interests are at stake \u2013 it simply regurgitates an elite-serving, western narrative.",

    "\nWithin hours of being published the Guardian piece was debunked as fake news.",
    "\nThat did not hinder other outlets to add to its smear.",
    "\nPolitico allowed \"a former CIA officer,\" writing under a pen name, to suggest - without any evidence - that the Guardian has been duped - not by its MI5/6 and Ecuadorian spy sources, but by Russian disinformation:\nRather than being the bombshell smoking gun that directly connects the Trump campaign to WikiLeaks, perhaps the report is something else entirely: a disinformation campaign.",
    "\nIs it possible someone planted this story as a means to discredit the journalists?",
    "\n...\nHarding is likely a major target for anyone wrapped up in Russia\u2019s intelligence operation against the West\u2019s democratic institutions.",
    "\n...",
    "\nIf this latest story about Manafort and Assange is false\u2014that is, if, for example, the sources lied to Harding and Collyns (or if the sources themselves were lied to and thus thought they were being truthful in their statements to the journalists), or if the Ecuadorian intelligence document is a fake, the most logical explanation is that it is an attempt to make Harding look bad.",
    "\nThe is zero evidence in the Politico screed that supports its suggestions and claims.",
    "\nIt is fake news about a fake news story.",
    "\nIt also included the false claim that Glenn Greenwald worked with Wikileaks on the Snowden papers.",
    "\nThat claim was later removed.",
    "\nWe have seen a similar pattern in the Skripal affair.",
    "\nWhen 'western' intelligence get caught in spreading disinformation, they accuse Russia of being the source of the fake.",
    "\nUnfortunately no western main stream media can any longer be trusted to publish the truth.",
    "\nThe Guardian is only one of many which peddle smears and disinformation about the 'enemies' of the ruling 'western interests'.",
    "\nIt is on all of us to debunk them and to educate the public about their scheme.",
    "\n---\nThis is a Moon of Alabama fundraiser week.",

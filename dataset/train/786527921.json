    "\nFrom Breitbart:\nAn email chain among senior Google executives from the day after the 2016 presidential election reveals the company tried to influence the 2016 United States presidential election on behalf of one candidate, Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton.",
    "\nIn the emails, a Google executive describes efforts to pay for free rides for a certain sect of the population to the polls\u2013a get-out-the-vote for Hispanic voters operation\u2013and how these efforts were because she thought it would help Hillary Clinton win the general election in 2016.",
    "\nShe also used the term \u201csilent donation\u201d to describe Google\u2019s contribution to the effort to elect Clinton president.",
    "\nThe main email, headlined, \u201cElection results and the Latino vote,\u201d was sent on Nov. 9, 2016\u2014the day after Clinton\u2019s loss to Trump in the 2016 presidential election\u2014by Eliana Murillo, Google\u2019s Multicultural Marketing department head.",
    "\nThe four page email begins with Murillo claiming she and others at Google were engaged in non-partisan activities not designed to help any one candidate or another\u2014only to undercut her own commentary in later passages in the emails by openly admitting the entire effort to boost Latino turnout using Google products with official company resources was to elect Clinton over Trump.",
    "\nThe critical miscalculation, Murillo wrote in a stunning admission in the email, was that Latino voters backed Trump by higher margins than any experts had forecast in the lead-up to the election.",
    "\nTrump\u2019s 29 percent among Hispanics nationally blew prognosticators away, and he hit even higher numbers\u2014about 31 percent\u2014in the key battleground state of Florida, Murillo admitted.",
    "\nMurillo wrote at the outset of the lengthy message:\nWe worked very hard.",
    "\nMany people did.",

    "\nWe kept our Google efforts non-partisan and followed our company\u2019s protocols for the elections strategy.",

    "\nA large percentage of Latino voters in Florida were new voters who had become citizens just in time to vote.",
    "\nWe saw high traffic for the search queries \u2018votar,\u2019 \u2018como votar,\u2019 and \u2018donde voter,\u2019 in key states like Florida and Nevada.",
    "\nWe will be pulling in more info in the coming hours/days but so far we definitely know there was high traffic on search in Spanish.",
    "\nWithout translating our tools the users wouldn\u2019t have found the information they needed.",
    "\nObjectively speaking, our goal was met \u2014 we pushed and successfully launched the search features in Spanish, and we thank Lisa for her support in advocating for this work.",
    "\nI sent Philipp a note yesterday to thank him because he and others voiced their support for this too, and we greatly appreciate it.",
    "\nEven Sundar gave the effort a shout out and a comment in Spanish, which was really special.",
    "\n\u201cSundar\u201d presumably refers to Google\u2019s chief executive officer Sundar Pichai, who took the reins of the massive search giant in October 2015.",
    "\n\u201cLisa\u201d presumably refers to Lisa Gevelber, the vice president of Global Marketing for Google\u2014who forwarded Murillo\u2019s entire four-page email to several other Google executives in another chain also obtained by Breitbart News in which Gevelber praises Murillo\u2019s activities with official company resources as having made a \u201cgreat difference.\u201d \u201cPhilipp\u201d presumably refers to Philipp Schindler, a senior vice president and Google\u2019s chief business officer per his LinkedIn page.",
    "\nThe emails were first revealed on Fox News on Monday evening on Tucker Carlson Tonight by anchor Tucker Carlson in a special report.",
    "\nBreitbart News also obtained them, and has reached out to Google with a number of questions about the emails.",
    "\nCarlson, in his exclusive report on Fox News Monday night, compared the revelations in the Google emails to the probe of Russian interference in the U.S. election to Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2014raising the question about how much influence tech giants like Google and Facebook have on election outcomes in the United States.",
    "\nCarlson cited Dr. Robert Epstein, a social scientist and an expert on Google, who has said, in Carlson\u2019s words, \u201cGoogle alone could determine the outcome of almost any election just by altering its search selections and we would never know it.\u201d\nEpstein has published research detailing how Google could influence the results of U.S. elections.",
    "\nBreitbart News has exclusively published several of Epstein\u2019s reports, including a recent one showing that Google search manipulation can swing huge swaths of voters.",
    "\nIn his report on Monday night, Carlson then described the emails he obtained, which Breitbart News also obtained.",
    "\nCarlson said:\nThis wasn\u2019t a get-out-the-vote effort or whatever they say.",
    "\nIt wasn\u2019t aimed at all potential voters.",
    "\nIt wasn\u2019t even aimed at a balanced cross-section of subgroups.",
    "\nGoogle didn\u2019t try to get out the vote among say Christian Arabs in Michigan or say Persian Jews in Los Angeles\u2014they sometimes vote Republican.",
    "\nIt was aimed only at one group, a group that Google cynically assumed would vote exclusively for the Democratic Party.",
    "\nFurthermore, this mobilization effort targeted not only the entire country but swing states vital to the Hillary campaign.",
    "\nThis was not an exercise in civics, this was political consulting.",
    "\nIt was in effect an in-kind contribution to the Hillary Clinton campaign.\u201d\nCarlson noted that in communication with Google, the company \u201cdid not deny that the email was real or that it showed a clear political preference.\u201d\n\u201cTheir only defense was that the activities they described were either non-partisan or were not officially taken by the company,\u201d Carlson said Monday night, describing Google\u2019s official response to his requests for comment, before challenging the company\u2019s response: \u201cBut of course they were both.",
    "\nPlenty of people in Google knew what was going on and we haven\u2019t seen any evidence anyone at Google disapproved of it and tried to rein it in.\u201d\nThe email from Murillo continues by explaining just how expansive the efforts the company undertook to achieve its objective were:\nWe had our partners help spread the word about our features on social media, including YouTubers and influencers like Dulce Candy, Jorge Narvaez, Jessie y Joy, Barbara Bermudo, and Pamela Silva of Univision, Jackie Cruz aka La Flaca from Orange is the New Black, and more.",
    "\nWe promoted our partner the Latino Community Foundation\u2019s non-partisan #YoVoyaVotaryTu (I\u2019m going to vote, are you?)",
    "\ncampaign and leveraged our social media influencer friends\u2019 reach to hit over 11M impressions with that hashtag.",
    "\nWe hosted an event with over 200 people and a hangout with social media influencers about the power of the Latino vote and the new research Nielsen published about the Latino electorate.",
    "\nThis reached 4.4M social media impressions and signaled to many that Google and our partners value the Latino community and our role in this election.",
    "\nWe brought the same research to the LATISM conference, where people were beyond thrilled to see Google\u2019s support and acknowledgment of the Latino community.",
    "\nIf Murillo had ended her email there, this probably would not amount to the level of a national news story.",
    "\nBut she did not: She went on for another several paragraphs on the first page and an extra three pages to admit the openly partisan intent of Google\u2019s actions, including a remarkable in-writing confirmation that at least one of Google\u2019s actions amounted to a \u201csilent donation\u201d\u2014something that could raise Federal Election Commission (FEC) red flags if authorities decide to launch an official investigation into this matter, now that these emails have been publicly revealed.",
    "\nIt is in the next paragraph that Murillo openly admits that Google made a \u201csilent donation,\u201d in her words, paying for rides to polls via leftist organization Voto Latino.",
    "\nMurillo wrote in the next paragraph:\nWe also supported partners like Voto Latino to pay for rides to the polls in key states (silent donation).",
    "\nWe even helped them create ad campaigns to promote the rides (with support from HOLA folks who rallied and volunteered their time to help).",
    "\nWe supported Voto Latino to help them land an interview with Senator Meza of Arizona (key state for us) to talk about the election and how to use Google search to find information about how to vote.",
    "\nThey were a strong partner, among many in this effort.",
    "\nThe next paragraph is where Murillo begins to make her next major admission: that the effort was not just to increase voter turnout generally but to elect Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump.",
    "\n\u201cUltimately, after all was said and done, the Latino community did come out to vote, and completely surprised us,\u201d Murillo wrote.",
    "\n\u201cWe never anticipated that 29% of Latinos would vote for Trump.",
    "\nNo one did.",
    "\nWe saw headlines like this about early voter turn out and thought that this was finally the year that the \u2018sleeping giant\u2019 had awoken.\u201d\nOn the next page, the email continues with a headline from an article in The Atlantic by James Fallows: \u201c2016: The Year Latinos Saved America?\u201d\nUnder that was a tweet from Jon Ralston of Ralston Reports in Nevada saying, among other things, that \u201cTrump is dead\u201d because of Latino turnout in early voting in the state.",
    "\nTrump did not end up winning Nevada in the end, but he did beat Clinton in 30 and a half other states.",
    "\n\u2026\nAt that point, after the Ralston tweet, Murillo openly admits the partisan motives of Google\u2019s electioneering efforts.",
    "\n\u201cOn personal note, we really thought we had shown up to demonstrate our political power against a candidate who had vehemently offended our community by calling us rapists and drug dealers,\u201d Murillo wrote.",
    "\n\u201cWe read the headline and thought WOW, we did it!\u201d\nMurillo\u2019s email continues by including another headline, this time from the New Yorker\u2019s Benjamin Wallace-Wells: \u201cLatino Voters Show Trump What It Means to Be American.\u201d That piece was written on Nov. 7, 2016, the day before the election.",
    "\nThen she begins writing again: \u201cBut then reality set in.",
    "\nOnly 71% of Latinos voted for Hillary, and that wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d\nThe third page of the email begins with another headline and image of a Latina woman in a red Make America Great Again hat and \u201cLatinos for Trump\u201d sign.",
    "\nThe story, from Ruben Navarette, Jr., published in the Daily Beast, is headlined: \u201cWhy the Latino Vote Didn\u2019t Save America.\u201d The sub-headline, \u201cHispanic voters were supposed to be one of Clinton\u2019s blue firewalls\u2014but one in three ended up splitting for Trump,\u201d is also included in Murillo\u2019s Google email.",
    "\nFrom there, Murillo continues writing for another page and a half:\nThe voters we wanted to reach did end up having an influence in the end, most notably in Florida.",
    "\nLatino voters voted for Trump more in Florida than in other states (31%), and FL was critical by popular vote and the electoral college.",
    "\nWe\u2019ll keep an eye on any other results that can show us the influence that our efforts had on the election.",
    "\nWe know we gave this our best and are now figuring out what comes next.",
    "\nThanks again for all your help and support in this effort.",
    "\nIn the next paragraph, Murillo again openly admits she was not \u201cobjective\u201d when it came to the election.",
    "\n\u201cI have tried to stay objective, but I ask that you please give us some time to pause and reflect,\u201d Murillo wrote.",
    "\n\u201cThis is devastating for our Democratic Latino community.",
    "\nAfter all these efforts and what we thought was positive momentum toward change, the results are not what we expected at all.",
    "\nWe are afraid for our families, and especially for the millions of immigrants who now don\u2019t know what the future holds for them.\u201d\nAfter that, Murillo says she cannot communicate with key organizers of the effort by Google and its partners\u2014a project known as HOLA\u2014because she is afraid of secret pro-Trump spies on the listservs created.",
    "\nShe also admits ongoing discussions among these people about meeting to give grieving Hillary Clinton supporters hugs after Trump crushed her on election day.",
    "\nShe also says those involved in Google\u2019s get-out-the-vote efforts were openly seeking consolation after Clinton lost, and that she and another person cried after Trump won \u2013 for the first time they have cried due to an election result.",
    "\nMurillo wrote:\nWhat\u2019s most difficult for us is we can\u2019t even email the HOLA list to reach our community and discuss what this means for us because we know that apparently some may actually be Trump supporters.",
    "\nThere is a thread right now among the core HOLA group where people are sharing how much they hurt, how much they need support right now, and that they are coordinating in different offices to meet up to just hold each other.",
    "\nOne in a remote office said \u2018If you guys do any sort of meetings, I\u2019d love to join virtually.",
    "\nI think I\u2019m currently the only Latinx in my office.",
    "\nIt\u2019s kinda hard.\u2019 #understatement.",
    "\nAnother said, \u2018I\u2019ve never cried after an election until last night.\u2019 Same here.",
    "\nShe was not done there.",
    "\nIn the next paragraph, Murillo wrote that this election result hurt her badly.",
    "\nShe also admits the election result was a \u201closs,\u201d another indication that Google\u2019s efforts were clearly attempting to use company resources to elect Democrat Clinton over Republican Trump and influence the results of the election.",
    "\nShe also says that the company\u2014and herself in particular\u2014will redouble efforts in the future to get a different and more desired result in future elections.",
    "\n\u201cI\u2019m in shock and it hurts more than I could have ever imagined, but trying to stay optimistic and keep my head high,\u201d Murillo wrote.",
    "\n\u201cLoss is a part of life, and I do think frustrations challenge us to work smarter and get creative.",
    "\nMy partners have sent notes and are saying the same thing \u2014 time to keep working harder.\u201d\nAt the top of the fourth page of the email, Murillo asks her colleagues at Google to give out a \u201csmile\u201d to grieving leftist Latinos who work at the company.",
    "\n\u201cIf you see a Latino Googler in the office (California/New York), please give them a smile,\u201d Murillo wrote.",
    "\n\u201cThey are probably hurting right now.",
    "\nIt\u2019s tough to handle now that we know not all of us were against this, so we may be even more divided than ever.",
    "\nAt least in CA/NY though, you can rest assured that the Latinos of these blue states need your thoughts and prayers, at least for them and their families.\u201d\nThen, she continues by stating she is going on a planned vacation she thought she was taking to \u201ccelebrate\u201d a Clinton win, but after Trump won, she says, her vacation \u201cwill be time to reflect on how to continue to support my community through these difficult times.\u201d\nMurillo, in the next line, reveals that she thought she was sharing her viewpoints on these matters in a tight circle that would not leak.",
    "\n\u201cI\u2019m not sharing my personal opinions very broadly, but wanted to share openly here in the circle of trust,\u201d she wrote.",
    "\nThis email leaked to Fox News and Breitbart News and is now likely to become a centerpiece in the case that Google is throwing its weight around to interfere in elections in the United States in a partisan manner against the duly elected President of the United States.",
    "\nThis email from Murillo was not just from some rogue staffer inside Google.",
    "\nHer original email was forwarded on to other Google executives by the aforementioned Gevelber, according to another email obtained by Breitbart News.",
    "\n\u201cThought you all would want to read this,\u201d Gevelber wrote in her own message endorsing Murillo\u2019s email in a message to other Google bigwigs.",
    "\n\u201cIt\u2019s from Eliana Murillo who runs US Hispanic Marketing on my team and who helped found HOLA our Hispanic ERC.\u201d\nGevelber continued by commending everyone she said, \u201cworked so hard to ensure all the Get out the Vote were done in Spanish\u201d that their efforts \u201cmade a giant difference\u201d in the election \u201cto Googlers and beyond.\u201d\nPresident Trump and Republicans have just begun scratching the surface of bias against them among Silicon Valley\u2019s elite, including, perhaps foremost alongside Facebook, from Google.",
    "\nA source close to the White House who has reviewed these emails ahead of their public release told Breitbart News that in a just world this would amount to, at a minimum, a clear violation of campaign finance law governing in-kind contributions to campaigns and causes.",

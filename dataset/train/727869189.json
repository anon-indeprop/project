    "\n(Reuters photo: Giorgio Perottino)\nIn a debate, Ross Douthat and Massimo Faggioli discussed Pope Francis\u2019s legacy and its effect on internal Church controversies.",
    "\nOn Wednesday night, New York Times columnist Ross Douthat and Villanova professor of theology Massimo Faggioli came together for a debate entitled \u201cFrancis @ Five: Assessing the Legacy of Pope Francis Five Years after His Election.\u201d As I made my way up to Fordham University, I was excited.",
    "\nHaving followed Douthat and Faggioli\u2019s ongoing dialogue on Twitter, I knew I was in for a lively, if predictable, conversation.",
    "\nIn his opening remarks, Douthat laid out three criteria that can be used to evaluate Francis\u2019s papacy thus far: his impact on the public\u2019s perception of the Church (a success); his attempts at reforming the Vatican bureaucracy (a disappointment); and his position on \u201cmoral-theological controversies,\u201d specifically, communion for the divorced and remarried (a problem).",
    "\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nFaggioli, meanwhile, outlined a genuinely surprising position.",
    "\nRather than making a straightforward case for why Pope Francis has changed the Church for the better, Faggioli rejected the possibility of evaluating his papacy in terms of \u201ccontinuity\u201d with past popes, since doing so would assume that \u201cChristianity at some point .",

    "\nInstead, through a combination of rhetorical tricks and soft-peddled Hegelianism, he would completely redefine the role and nature of the Catholic Church.",
    "\nDuring the crux of the debate \u2014 the discussion of communion for the divorced and remarried \u2014 Faggioli raised his most theologically unsettling point.",
    "\nTo defend his position that remarried persons should be able to receive communion, Faggioli invoked the case of Germany, where 50 percent of Catholic marriages end in divorce.",
    "\nFor Faggioli, the implication is that at least 50 percent of German Catholic children never see their parents receive communion and lose their faith because of it.",
    "\nThis, he says, is \u201cbad for evangelization,\u201d and in order to keep the pews full, the Church\u2019s role should not be to deny communion to the divorced and remarried, but instead to ask, \u201cWhat can the Catholic Church do to make the faithful able to receive sacraments?\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThis is a lovely suggestion, and one that I\u2019m not entirely unsympathetic to.",
    "\nHowever, the fact remains that Faggioli is suggesting the Church do much more than provide sacraments to the faithful.",
    "\nJust before invoking the German case, Faggioli characterized the country as one of the most secular in the world.",
    "\nBut rather than lamenting what secularism has wrought on marital life in Germany, reasserting the Church\u2019s position on marriage, and insisting that the faithful strive to live according to her laws, Faggioli argues that the Church ought to bend to the will of secular society.",
    "\nAdvertisement\nIt should be clear to anyone, not just practicing Catholics, that this is absurd.",

    "\nUnsurprisingly, this progressive interpretation of Catholic doctrine eventually reveals itself to be rank historicism.",
    "\nThroughout the debate, Faggioli drew out the argument that allowing the remarried to receive communion would not represent a radical change in doctrine but a return to the teachings of the Gospel.",
    "\nEventually, Douthat drew his argument to its logical conclusion with this question: Were priests throughout history in fact misleading their divorced and remarried parishioners by telling them they could not receive communion?",
    "\nAfter a few seconds\u2019 pause, Faggioli gave the only answer he could: \u201cThere are different responses to the same question in different times.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThroughout their conversation, both Douthat and Faggioli repeatedly observed that the debate over Pope Francis and the future of the Church is carried on primarily among Catholic intellectuals, unbeknownst to most of \u201cthe flock.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nIt strikes me, however, that everybody \u2014 Catholic or not \u2014 has a dog in this fight, which is about more than communion and canon law.",

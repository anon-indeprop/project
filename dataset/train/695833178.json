    "Confirmed: Authorities LIED About Las Vegas Shooter\u2019s Hotel Check-In Date \u2013 What Else Are They Hiding?",
    "\n\nOver the last few days the alternative media has spent countless hours conducting their own investigations into what actually happened during the mass shooting in Las Vegas that left 59 dead and over 500 injured.",
    "\nFrom reports of multiple shooters to officials seemingly covering up the ISIS connection, many different theories have been put forth that counter the mainstream narrative.",
    "\nNow, new information released by investigative reporter Laura Loomer proves that authorities have directly lied to the American people about the case at least once by claiming that supposed shooter Stephen Paddock checked into the Mandalay Bay Hotel on September 28th when valet records (with photos) prove he actually arrived three days earlier.",
    "\nAccording to Loomer, she obtained the image from a source which shows that Paddock\u2019s car first arrived September 25th.",
    "\nThe photo even has a handwritten note that was reportedly written by an FBI agent \u2013 proving that the FBI specifically lied to the country.",

    "\nLaw enforcement and @FBI misled the public about #Paddock\u2018s check in date and also provided public & media w/ wrong license plate number.",

    "\nThis throws their entire narrative into question and makes one wonder what else is being hidden from the public?",
    "\nKeep in mind that at least four videos from the scene of the shooting have already been released that indicate there were multiple shooters.",
    "\nIn fact, there are so many unanswered questions that the Drudge Report even linked to an article asking them directly.",
    "\nAs noted above, at this point literally every piece of so-called evidence put forth by authorities and then regurgitated by the mainstream media cannot be trusted and should be considered as disinformation until proven otherwise.",
    "\nAnd if Paddock really did act alone and this evidence is some sort of mistake, there is surely video footage proving so.",

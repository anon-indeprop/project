    "Muslim Crime Stopper Sofian Zakkout's New Crush: Anti-Semite Pastor Steve Anderson\n\nFor nearly two millennia, Jews have suffered persecution after persecution at the hands of those who used religion as a vehicle for hate and even mass murder.",
    "\nRecently, a video clip of anti-Semitic pastor Steve Anderson \u2013 making the claim that Jews have experienced such abuse because they have somehow been cursed \u2013 wound up on the personal Facebook page of South Florida Muslim leader Sofian Zakkout.",
    "\nAccording to Zakkout, who sits on the boards of two anti-crime groups, Anderson\u2019s declaration \u201cmakes a lot of sense.\u201d With statements like this from Zakkout and worse, why would groups committed to fighting crime continue to compromise themselves and sabotage their mission by affiliating with him?",
    "\nSofian Abdelaziz Zakkout is the President of the American Muslim Association of North America (AMANA), a prominent Islamic organization headquartered in North Miami Beach, Florida.",
    "\nOn January 25th, Zakkout posted onto his personal Facebook page a video clip of a speech made by Steve Anderson, the pastor of the Faithful Word Baptist Church in Tempe, Arizona.",
    "\nAnderson is notorious for calling for the killing of gays to end AIDS.",
    "\nIn the clip, Anderson states the following: \u201cAnd the Jews were scattered into all nations for literally 2000 years, right?",
    "\nFor 1800 sum odd years.",
    "\nAnd by the way, everywhere they were scattered, they were persecuted, hated, treated badly.",
    "\nWhy?",
    "\n\u2018Cause God\u2019s blessing them?",
    "\nNo.",
    "\n\u2018Cause they\u2019re under the curse of God for having rejected the Lord Jesus Christ.\u201d\nBlaming Jews for the extreme torment they endured for so long, which includes a Nazi Holocaust that took the lives of six million innocent Jews and so many others, is incredibly offensive.",
    "\nIndeed, statements and beliefs such as Anderson\u2019s have provoked hatred and persecution of Jews.",
    "\nTowards the end of the clip, which is less than four minutes in length, Anderson throws the anti-Semitism in people\u2019s faces.",
    "\nHe zealously states, while drawing laughter from his small audience, \u201cYou say, \u2018Why are you preaching against the Jews?\u2019 Well, don\u2019t come back next Wednesday night.",
    "\nBecause, next Wednesday night, God\u2019s wrath is on the Jews even more!\u201d\nAbout the clip, on Facebook, Zakkout wrote above it, \u201cMakes a lot of sense!\u201d Of course, this is coming from someone [Zakkout] who regularly refers to Jews as \u201cmonkeys and pigs,\u201d and in February 2016, circulated on social media a report claiming that \u201cthe Holocaust was faked.\u201d The report calls the Holocaust \u201cthe biggest lie ever foisted upon humanity\u201d and was produced by a media outlet which describes Hitler as \u201cthe greatest leader in modern Western history.\u201d\nBoth Anderson and Zakkout have been denounced by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) for their propagation of anti-Semitism.",
    "\nIn July 2010, the ADL condemned Zakkout and his group AMANA for featuring an anti-Jewish video produced by former KKK leader and white supremacist David Duke on the AMANA website.",
    "\nThe ADL described the video as \u201cvenomous.\u201d In October 2015, Zakkout praised Duke, as \u201cDavid Duke, a man to believe in!\u201d\nBesides posting videos from Steve Anderson and David Duke on his Facebook page, Zakkout also, in July 2017, posted a four minute clip from a speech made by Nation of Islam (NOI) leader Louis Farrakhan.",
    "\nDuring the clip, Farrakhan repeatedly labels the Jewish people \u201cSatan.\u201d He states, \u201cReally, they\u2019re not Jews.",
    "\nNo, that\u2019s Satan.",
    "\nYou should learn to call them by their real name, \u2018Satan.\u2019 You\u2019re coming face to face with Satan, the Arch Deceiver, the enemy of God, and the enemy of the righteous.\u201d\nZakkout is also an ardent supporter of the terrorist organization Hamas, if not a member himself.",
    "\nIn July 2014, he organized a pro-Hamas rally held outside the Israeli Consulate in downtown Miami.",
    "\nRally goers repeatedly shouted, \u201cWe are Hamas\u201d and \u201cLet\u2019s go Hamas.\u201d After the rally, Zakkout wrote the following in Arabic, above photos from the event: \u201cThank God, every day we conquer the American Jews like our conquests over the Jews of Israel!\u201d He signed it \u201cBr.",
    "\nSofian Zakkout.\u201d The next month, Zakkout declared in Arabic, \"Hamas is in my heart and on my head.\"",
    "\nAll of the above testifies to hatred and intolerance, but it is even more disturbing given the fact that Zakkout sits on the boards of two anti-crime organizations: Crime Stoppers of Miami-Dade County and Citizens\u2019 Crime Watch of Miami-Dade County.",
    "\nServing alongside Zakkout on these boards are local politicians and law enforcement officials.",
    "\nOne would think that they would find Zakkout\u2019s actions and bigotry unacceptable, as well, yet Zakkout continues to serve unchallenged.",
    "\nIf the board members of Crime Stoppers and Citizens\u2019 Crime Watch do not wish to be associated with anti-Semitism or white supremacism or Hamas or Holocaust denial or Steve Anderson or David Duke or Louis Farrakhan, then they must cut ties with Sofian Zakkout.",
    "\nThe time is long overdue that these groups maintain their credibility and remain true to their stated missions of protecting and safeguarding the American public.",
    "\nSofian Zakkout\u2019s bigoted and radical agenda is antithetical to this and is a documented threat to national security.",
    "\nHis presence on the boards of both organizations constitutes an obscene travesty.",
    "\nOnce and for all, these groups need to divorce themselves from Zakkout and repudiate what he stands for.",
    "\nBeila Rabinowitz, Director of Militant Islam Monitor, contributed to this report."

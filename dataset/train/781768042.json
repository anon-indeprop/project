    "\n-Genesis 18:16-33\nGot questions.org explains very well\u2026\nGenesis chapter 19 records the two angels, disguised as human men, visiting Sodom and Gomorrah.",
    "\nLot met the angels in the city square and urged them to stay at his house.",
    "\nThe angels agreed.",
    "\nThe Bible then informs us, \"Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom \u2014 both young and old \u2014 surrounded the house.",
    "\nThey called to Lot, 'Where are the men who came to you tonight?",
    "\nBring them out to us so that we can have sex with them.",
    "\nGenesis 19:4-5 The angels then proceed to blind all the men of Sodom and Gomorrah and urge Lot and his family to flee from the cities to escape the wrath that God was about to deliver.",
    "\nLot and his family flee the city, and then \"the LORD rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah \u2014 from the LORD out of the heavens.",
    "\nThus he overthrew those cities and the entire plain, including all those living in the cities...\" (Genesis 19:2 4) .",
    "\nIn light of the passage, the most common response to the question, \"What was the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah?\"",
    "\nis that it was homosexuality.",
    "\nThat is how the term \u201dsodomy\u201d came to be used to refer to anal sex between two men, whether consensual or forced.",
    "\nClearly, homosexuality was part of the reason God destroyed the two cities.",
    "\nThe men of Sodom and Gomorrah wanted to perform homosexual gang rape on the two angels, who were disguised as men.",
    "\nAt the same time, it is not biblical to say that homosexuality was the exclusive reason why God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.",
    "\nThe cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were definitely not exclusive in terms of the sins in which they indulged.",
    "\nEzekiel 16:49-50 declares, \"Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy.",
    "\nThey were haughty and did detestable things before me...\" The Hebrew word translated \"detestable\" refers to something that is morally disgusting and is the exact same word used in Leviticus 18:22 that refers to homosexuality as an \"abomination.\"",
    "\nSimilarly, Jude 7 declares, \"...Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion.\"",
    "\nSo, again, while homosexuality was not the only sin in which the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah indulged, it does appear to be the primary reason for the destruction of the cities.",
    "\nThose who attempt to explain away the biblical condemnations of homosexuality claim that the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah was inhospitality.",
    "\nThe men of Sodom and Gomorrah were certainly being inhospitable.",
    "\nThere is probably nothing more inhospitable than homosexual gang rape.",
    "\nBut to say God completely destroyed two cities and all their inhabitants for being inhospitable clearly misses the point.",
    "\nWhile Sodom and Gomorrah were guilty of many other horrendous sins, homosexuality was the reason God poured fiery sulfur on the cities, completely destroying them and all of their inhabitants.",
    "\nTo this day, the area where Sodom and Gomorrah were located remains a desolate wasteland.",
    "\nSodom and Gomorrah serve as a powerful example of how God feels about sin in general, and homosexuality specifically.",
    "\nThe point is that there were no righteous to be spared and the Lord did what man failed to do when they had the time to do it.",
    "\nQuestion: How do you show mercy to a people who observe lying vanities (Jonah 2:4) and refuse to return to the Lord (Jeremiah 6:16) on His terms?",
    "\n(Jeremiah 22:3) God must be true and judgment must commence.",
    "\nMen today, like those of Sodom and Gomorrah, are not valiant for the truth.",
    "\nThey are valiant to proceed from evil to evil (Jeremiah 5).",
    "\nThey care more about the pleasures of sin for a season, than they are grieved for the afflictions of Joseph (Amos 6:6; Hebrews 11:25).",
    "\nMen today care more of compromise (where two men both agree on what they both know is wrong) and diplomacy (seduction in another guise) in promoting anarchy through \u201cantinomianism\u201d than they do the Law of God against the sins unto judgment that enslave men (John 8:34).",
    "\nInstead of establishing judgment within the gate and hating the evil and loving the good (Amos 5:15) in hopes that the Lord may be gracious to their repentance (2 Corinthians 7:10), they reject the counsel of God against them by hating the good and loving the evil, and that to their own damnation.",
    "\nThey care more about the approbation and favor of men than they do that of the Living God and what His Word declares (Galatians 1:10),not knowing that which his highly favored among men is an abomination unto the Lord (Luke 16:15).",
    "\nThey wear the cross.",
    "\nYet, they have no testimony of the power of God unto salvation by the cross because they do not practice what Christ required: \u201cDeny yourselves and take up your cross and follow Me\u201d (Matthew 16:24; Romans 1:16; 2 Corinthians 5:15, 13:4-5; Galatians 2:21).",
    "\nProfessed Christians in America today talk much of love through inaction, and yet know nothing of it (1 John 3:18).",
    "\nThey read what to do, but do it not!",
    "\nIn fact, they declare and proclaim how much they love God, and yet if you were to have them read His moral law and look to their own lives, they would find how much they actually hate God through their actions (Matthew 15:8).",
    "\nThen again, these were the same types of people in Jerusalem crying out \"Crucify him!",
    "\nCrucify him!",
    "\nWe have no king but Caesar\" (John 19:15).",
    "\nAnd these are the same people today persecuting living Christians while praising the dead ones (Matthew 5:10).",
    "\nThey continuously preach of the heroism of Abraham, Moses, Joshua, David, Gideon, Samson and others from the pulpit and fail to understand what these men were doing when serving their generations (Psalm 71:18-19; Isaiah 51:4).",
    "\nToday, instead of doing the same, they simply hide under a false grace (Isaiah 30) and give themselves over to a man, the president, and declare end times.",
    "\nThey declare we're in the end times because they have failed to stand up and fight for their posterity in keeping the Lord's commandments and His judgments (Psalm 78:1-11).",
    "\nUngrateful reprobates, pretenders, counterfeits and hypocrites are what they are (Matthew 23:3).",
    "\nInstead of reaching out to the greatest demographic here in America, public high schools, they send missionaries to foreign lands to do there what they fail to do for their own here.",
    "\nInstead of fighting for their posterity and shutting down the illegalities of sodomy in all 50 states, they teach them to just do their best to understand that they cannot help themselves while God say\u2019s the opposite (Leviticus 20:18).",
    "\nInstead of fighting on their behalf against the federal government that is illegally indoctrinating them, they simply give their kids over to them to be dumbed down.",
    "\nAnd instead of protesting the murder of 58 million innocent babies (Proverbs 6:17), they merely pass it off as a \"choice,\" that being the lessons that they learned from the media that they say that they do not believe (Romans 1:18).",
    "\nThe American Church, instead of protesting corruption in government through the example of the Biblical patriarchs and our American forefathers (Matthew 5:17-18), teach to submit to tyranny as if to suggest that it is somehow obedience to God (Romans 12:21).",
    "\nThe Church in America has failed to keep the Commandments of the God of Israel.",
    "\nInstead of preaching out against sin, they advocate for that which God clearly condemns, thereby making war against God (Micah 3:5), which at length destroys our government, our country and our families.",
    "\nLook to their feigned strength that they profess to possess.",
    "\nIt is gauged by simply looking to the prevailing immoralities and debauchers of society.",
    "\nThey are weak and pathetic and they have no excuses as to why America is where we is today!",
    "\nWhy did God judge Sodom and Gomorrah?",
    "\nIt's the same reason that he is judging America today (Amos 4:12), He cannot find the righteous in order to spare her (Jeremiah 22:3).",
    "\nDefining the Wicked\u2026\nWicked men in the sight of God are those who have the knowledge of what to do when it comes to the right, but over and over again, they turn their shoulders and choose the wrong, through tolerance and apathy Americans are bringing upon themselves destruction (Deuteronomy 30:19) that will not be reversed, which leaves no alternative as to why God judges and is judging America today (Deuteronomy 28:63).",

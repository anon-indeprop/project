    "Et Tu, Benedict?",
    "\n(Some Final Thoughts on Joseph Ratzinger)\n\nRecently an editor of a \u201cconservative\u201d Catholic magazine asked me if I would be interested in contributing a piece about the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI, five years on.",
    "\nI declined, telling him that I was morally certain that anything I had to say about it would not be in keeping with his editorial policies.",
    "\nIt\u2019s been five years, and I\u2019ve noticed that there are a lot fewer people talking about what a \u201ccourageous\u201d act it was to give up the pontificate.",
    "\nThe consequences of that act have been so outlandish \u2013 even for people who are mostly OK with Francis \u2013 that very few people are still willing to make polite noises about it.",
    "\nEditor's Note: In a March 11th letter signed by Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI and addressed to Msgr.",
    "\nDario Vigano, prefect of the Secretariat for Communications, the former pope reportedly offers an impassioned defense of Pope Francis against the claim that he lacks theological and philosophical formation.",
    "\nIn no uncertain terms, this letter, bearing Benedict's signature, affirms that \u201cthere is an internal continuity between the two pontificates.\u201d Whether Benedict actually wrote this letter or not, it gives rise to a number of grave questions that need to be answered rather urgently before history closes the book on this commedia diabolica.",
    "\nOur thanks to Remnant columnist, Hilary White, for addressing the most pertinent of these here below.",
    "\nMJM\nIn fact, five years after the resignation of Pope Benedict the Catholic faithful mostly want to know why; why would a pope \u2013 a man with decades of up-close-and-personal experience of the \u201cfilth\u201d in the Curia and throughout the church \u2013 suddenly just decide to quit?",
    "\nWhy would he choose to walk away knowing that his task was not completed?",
    "\nAt the time and since then, particularly in light of what has been happening, it seems one of the most bizarre aspects of this whole bizarre situation that the reasons offered have been so trivial, so inappropriately, so disproportionately petty.",
    "\nThese absurd responses to serious questions of grave import have raised the inescapable suspicion that Benedict simply did not take the papacy as seriously as the rest of us did.",
    "\nWe cannot help but wonder if these trivialised responses reveal some deep flaw that we had never suspected before.",
    "\nCould we have been wrong about him?",
    "\nAnd if so, could we have been this wrong?",
    "\nFor reasons, all we heard at the time was, essentially, \u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d There was some implication that he didn\u2019t feel up to international travel anymore, so couldn\u2019t make it to World Youth Day and similar events.",
    "\nThe trivialising of the resignation seemed to go hand in hand with the modern concept of the pope-as-pop-star, something we had thought Benedict was too serious a man, too serious a Catholic, to believe himself.",
    "\nOf all people, we had assumed that Benedict XVI took the papacy seriously.",
    "\nAnd since then, as all the poisons that had been lurking for fifty years in the NewChurch mud are busily hatching out, many Catholics want to know why we hear nothing from him?",
    "\nThis man whom we had believed a \u201cchampion of orthodoxy,\u201d whom we thought we knew.",
    "\nError, even heresy and blasphemy are pouring daily out of the mouth of his successor, who has, literally, turned the Vatican into a den of thieves, and we hear nothing but the occasional, carefully worded statement on how fine everything is.",
    "\nHow content he is with his decision and how happy with his current life.",
    "\nAfter three years of systematic dismantling of everything he had attempted to do in his pontificate, we got this from an apparently utterly insouciant Ratzinger, addressed to Francis: \u201cYour goodness is my home and the place where I feel safe.\u201d Everyone who had ever read anything he had written were amazed he was capable of producing such maudlin drivel, but the video doesn\u2019t lie:\nSo strange was this new tone that speculation started circulating that he was under some kind of external compulsion, not free to speak his mind.",
    "\nBut this is not what we see.",
    "\nThere he is, manifestly happy and reading it out loud.",
    "\n\u201cPerhaps it was written for him.\u201d Well, why repeat it then?",
    "\nWhy, if he has any qualms, allow himself to be trotted out on such occasions, to read this blatant propaganda?",
    "\nIf it is a deception, why participate in it?",
    "\nIn fact, all the hopeful commenters on blogs and other social media who keep telling me how much they \u201cmiss\u201d him have failed to respect him in one way; they won\u2019t take him at his word.",
    "\nSome insist that his resignation was under some sort of coercion and so isn\u2019t valid.",
    "\nBut we have repeatedly heard from him that he was under no constraint, that he had resigned freely.",
    "\nAnd indeed, far from being an isolated \u201cprisoner of the Vatican,\u201d Benedict has received many guests all of whom report that, though frail, he appears content and never utters a word of criticism.",
    "\nWe have yet to hear any report of any notes begging for rescue hidden under a lunch table placemat.",
    "\nThere\u2019s no doubt that this is an extremely strange and frankly fishy situation; something doesn\u2019t add up, it\u2019s true.",
    "\nAll the questions have gone ignored, or have received frivolous, jokey responses:\nWhy did you resign?",
    "\nRatzinger: \u201cI was a bit tired and didn\u2019t feel up to partying with the kids at World Youth Day.\u201d\nIf you\u2019re not pope, why do you still wear the white?",
    "\nRatzinger: \u201cOh, there wasn\u2019t a black cassock that fit me.\u201d\nWhy do you continue to call yourself Benedict XVI if you are no longer pope?",
    "\nRatzinger: \u201cWell, I\u2019m an \u2018emeritus,\u2019 you see\u2026\u201d\nAnd where did this \u201cemeritus\u201d business come from?",
    "\nDoes it have any precedent in Catholic history?",
    "\nWhat does it mean canonically and doctrinally?",
    "\nRatzinger: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nWhat was all that rubbish from Ganswein about there being a divided \u201cmunus\u201d \u2013 with an active member and a \u201ccontemplative member\u201d?",
    "\nDoesn\u2019t that just mean there are two popes now?",
    "\nRatzinger: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nAnd perhaps most agonising of all: \u201cHow can you just sit there smiling, issuing bland platitudinous nonsense, while this lunatic drives the sheep off a cliff?\u201d\nA few days ago, my friend Steve Skojec, of the traditionalist/restorationist website One Peter Five, summed up the consternation of those of us who still feel a lingering affection for (the man we used to call) Pope Benedict.",
    "\nSteve summons up in this brief post all the anger and all the crushing disappointment most of us probably still feel reluctant to express out loud:\nFive years ago today, Pope Benedict XVI abdicated the papacy.",
    "\nAnd through the abandonment of his duty to shepherd the Church, he made way for the worst papacy of all time \u2013 one he steadfastly refuses to oppose in word, deed, or even the subtlest gesture.",
    "\nYou may love him for various reasons, you may miss him by contrast, but you may not excuse the responsibility he has.",
    "\nHe walked away from his family, leaving the door open to an abusive stepfather, and he watches his children beaten and led astray not just in silence, but in apparent contentment.",
    "\nAnd still, he was the best of the post-conciliar popes, which is why he\u2019s the only one who won\u2019t be canonized.",
    "\nWho is the real Joseph Ratzinger?",
    "\nI have had long-time Vatican watchers say to me, more than once, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s really just that he wasn\u2019t who we thought he was.\u201d I suspect there is a lot more to this than most people might imagine.",
    "\nI think we made the mistake of believing the press.",
    "\nWe were delighted that the bitterly anti-Catholic media hated and feared him.",
    "\nWe failed to recall that they know nothing at all about Catholicism.",
    "\nWhat the papers never told us was that as a young priest and theologian Joseph Ratzinger was known as a \u201cprogressive,\u201d as the term was understood in 1962.",
    "\nThis reputation was cemented during his work as the peritus, the theological advisor, of one of the Council\u2019s most influential of the bishops of the progressive camp, Cardinal Josef Frings of Cologne.",
    "\nFrings\u2019 claim to fame in that great drama was a speech criticising the CDF \u2013 and its prefect Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani \u2013 for the \u201cconservatism\u201d in the \u201cschema,\u201d the documents prepared by the CDF for guiding the bishops\u2019 discussions.",
    "\nAfter this speech, there was an uprising among the bishops of the preparatory committee who demanded that the schema \u2013 that had taken years to develop \u2013 be abandoned.",
    "\nThis was done, over Ottaviani\u2019s futile objections, and new documents were rapidly cobbled together by a coalition of German and French \u201cprogressives\u201d who rejoiced that they had, in effect, seized control of the Council from that moment, before it had even started.",
    "\nIt has since been revealed that it was Joseph Ratzinger \u2013 the maverick \u201cprogressive\u201d academic theologian Frings had brought to Rome as his secretary \u2013 who wrote that speech.",
    "\nCardinal Henri de Lubac, writing in 1985, recalling that drama, said:\n\u201cJoseph Ratzinger, an expert at the Council, was also the private secretary of Card.",
    "\nFrings, Archbishop of Cologne.",
    "\nBlind, the old Cardinal largely utilized his secretary to write his interventions.",
    "\nNow then, one of these interventions became memorable: it was a radical criticism of the methods of the Holy Office.",
    "\nDespite a reply by Card.",
    "\nOttaviani, Frings sustained his critique.",
    "\n\n\u201cIt is not an exaggeration to say that on that day the old Holy Office, as it presented itself then, was destroyed by Ratzinger in union with his Archbishop.",
    "\n\n\u201cCard.",
    "\nSeper, a man full of goodness, intiated the renovation.",
    "\nRatzinger, who did not change, continues it.\u201d\nRatzinger\u2019s reputation as a \u201cprogressive\u201d is not based on one incident, nor was it restricted to his early work.",
    "\nIt went unnoticed in the shouting over his running of CDF, that he had written in 1982, a call for the Church \u201cnever to return\u201d to the Syllabus of Errors of Pius IX.",
    "\nIn his book Principles of Catholic Theology, Ratzinger proposed the question, \u201cShould the Council be revoked?\u201d and in response recommended the \u201crazing of the bastions\u201d of the Catholic Church in relation to the modern world:\nThe duty is, therefore, not to suppress the Council, but to discover the real Council and delve deep into what it truly wants with regard to what has happened since then.",
    "\n\nThis implies that there is no possible return to the Syllabus, which could well have been a first step in the combat against Liberalism and the nascent Marxism, but which cannot be the last word.",
    "\nNeither embraces nor the ghetto can resolve the problem of [relations with] the modern world for the Christian.",
    "\nHence, the 'razing of the bastions' that Hans Urs von Balthasar called for already in 1952 was in effect an urgent duty.",
    "\nIt was necessary for her [the Church] to raze the old bastions and confide only in the protection of the faith, the power of the word that is her unique, true, and permanent strength.",
    "\nBut to raze the bastions cannot signify that she no longer has anything to protect, or that she can live owing to different forces than those that engendered her: the water and the blood that poured from the open side of her crucified Lord.",
    "\nHis was the thesis \u2013 a mainstay of \u201cconservative\u201d ideology \u2013 that the \u201creal\u201d Council, if only implemented properly, would be the salvation of the Church and the world, a theme he never left.",
    "\nHow ironic it must have seemed to those who remembered this history that Ratzinger would himself be given the office he had \u201cdestroyed\u201d and would gain the media-generated reputation as an \u201carch-conservative\u201d.",
    "\nAnd it starts to suggest an answer, or at least a line of inquiry, about why so little was actually accomplished in his long tenure.",
    "\nWith the \u201carch-conservative\u201d \u201cRottweiler\u201d Ratzinger in CDF, why do we have the situation we have today?",
    "\nWhat did he do to stop the explosion of neo-modernism \u2013 that burned like an unchecked wildfire throughout the Catholic world through the reign of John Paul II?",
    "\nWhat did \u201csilencing\u201d by Ratzinger\u2019s CDF do to stop Hans Kung becoming a celebrity \u201cpriest-theologian,\u201d courted by the media for his loathing of Catholicism?",
    "\nKung, who was never removed from the priesthood despite his manifest heresy?",
    "\nCan we think of any other names who were corrected even to this degree?",
    "\nPrecious few.",
    "\nBut we can certainly think of many, many who spent their lives and vocations blatantly denying and undermining the Catholic Faith \u2013 academic theologians, religious, priests, bishops and cardinals around the world \u2013 with never a peep of protest from Rome.",
    "\nMoreover, the scandalous pack of frauds we currently have in the episcopate is entirely the product of the \u201carch-conservative\u201d John Paul II and the \u201cRottweiler\u201d Benedict XVI pontificates.",
    "\nWhy did we think that Ratzinger, in this crucial role of CDF prefect, was a bulwark of orthodoxy?",
    "\nIs it simply that we have moved so far away from the ancient Faith that we no longer have a realistic notion of the Faith ourselves to make a comparison, to make an objective judgement?",
    "\nThe \u201cprogressive\u201d destroyer of Ottaviani inheriting his office and the epithet \u201carch-conservative\u201d\u2026\nIndeed, Ratzinger himself maintained that he had never changed his theological opinions.",
    "\nHe was to say that it was his old academic colleagues like Kung and Kasper who had moved further to the ideological \u201cleft\u201d after the 1960s while he stayed in place.",
    "\nPerhaps now, as an answer that fits our apparently contradictory puzzle pieces, we can finally accept his word on this.",
    "\nPerhaps the world of Catholic academic theology had become so corrupted that a man called \u201cprogressive\u201d in 1963, but whose ideas remained the same, would look like a \u201cchampion of traditional Catholic orthodoxy\u201d by 2005.",
    "\nIs this why he resigned?",
    "\nIs it simply that his conception of the Church, of the papacy, was never what Catholics believed about it?",
    "\nPerhaps a hint at the answer comes from La Stampa in 2015 which published some of the memoirs of Silvano Fausti, SJ, who had been confessor and spiritual guide of Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini, the godfather of the \u201cliberal\u201d European Catholic Church, and alleged leader of the \u201cSankt Gallen Mafia\u201d that Cardinal Danneels admitted conspired for years against Pope Benedict.",
    "\nFausti said that Benedict met with Martini at the bishops\u2019 palace of Milan in June 2012.",
    "\nMartini, Fausti said, urged Benedict to resign the papacy.",
    "\nApparently at the time of his election in 2005, Martini had said it would be his main task to reform the Curia.",
    "\nBy 2012, this had proved impossible.",
    "\nWhy would Benedict take advice from a man like Martini \u2013 the \u201cgodfather\u201d of the \u201cliberal wing\u201d of European Catholicism?",
    "\nI think the question would not even occur to a man like Ratzinger.",
    "\nThey were esteemed academic colleagues.",
    "\nThey were brothers of the episcopate.",
    "\nThey were members of the club.",
    "\nAny appearance of ideological division between them was, in essence, a product of the media narrative.",
    "\nWhy wouldn\u2019t the pope take the advice of his most respected and senior cardinal?",
    "\nWhy is Walter Kasper a cardinal?",
    "\nOne of the most prominent of those puzzle pieces is the apparent inability of these \u201cconservative\u201d prelates, to detect, let alone effectively oppose, these brazen enemies of the Faith within the episcopate and College of Cardinals.",
    "\nIt beggars belief of ordinary people that, after so many years of hearing and reading them, Ratzinger would remain on such friendly terms with men like Walter Kasper and Carlo Maria Martini, the alleged brains of the Sankt Gallen Mafia.",
    "\nWhen, at his very first Angelus address in 2013, Pope Francis told the crowd how much he loved the writing of Walter Kasper, quite a lot of us who had spent many years watching the Vatican started understanding where we were all headed with the new pope.",
    "\nJorge Bergoglio might have been unknown to the larger Catholic world, but Walter Kasper was a celebrity heretic, the media-savvy frontman for the \u201cultra-liberal\u201d \u201cwing\u201d of the post-Vatican II Church.",
    "\nIn an article on the cardinal\u2019s life\u2019s work, Thomas Jansen, the editor-in-chief of Katholisch.de, recently noted that Walter Kasper could not possibly have done the damage he has without the direct assistance of both John Paul II and Pope Benedict.",
    "\nThe monstrous debacle of Amoris Laetitia is as much Kasper\u2019s work as Bergoglio\u2019s.",
    "\nThis is a man who has, for 40 years, never troubled to hide his heterodox opinions and has devoted much of his life to a campaign to bring about precisely this outcome.",
    "\nJansen points out that Kasper had already tried to bring out the same proposal for Communion for divorced and remarried in 1993, together with Karl Lehmann, another \u201cSankt Gallen\u201d member.",
    "\nThis was stopped by Ratzinger and the CDF.",
    "\nBut that raises the next question; if Ratzinger knew so well what kind of creature Kasper was, why wasn\u2019t the next step to pitch him out of the episcopate on his ear?",
    "\nWhy was he not \u2013 at the very least \u2013 given the same \u201csilencing\u201d treatment as Kung?",
    "\nKasper has recently gone to the media again to complain of being called a heretic.",
    "\nBut it\u2019s a simple truth: he\u2019s a heretic.",
    "\nEveryone knows he\u2019s a heretic because we have heard him trumpeting in his blatant heresies from every rooftop he could find for decades.",
    "\nAfter openly working against the Faith, instead of being demoted, silenced, laicised and/or excommunicated, John Paul II made him a cardinal.",
    "\nRemember that his scheme to Amoris-Latitia-ize the Church was stopped by Ratzinger\u2019s CDF in 1993.",
    "\nBut he was not demoted, reprimanded or corrected in any way.",
    "\nNor was he removed from places of influence.",
    "\nFar from it.",
    "\nIn 1994 Kasper was inserted into the Vatican Curia by being named co-chair of the International Commission for Lutheran-Catholic Dialogue.",
    "\nIn 1999, he made another step up, being appointed secretary of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, the \u201cecumenical\u201d office where his manifest religious indifferentism could be given free reign.",
    "\nIn 2001, he was made a Cardinal-deacon with the awesome responsibility of voting in a Conclave.",
    "\nThen Benedict allowed him to remain a cardinal.",
    "\nAnd, as if to add a finishing touch to the poisoned cake that is Ratzinger\u2019s involvement in the creation of the New Catholic Paradigm, Benedict is now being said to have deliberately timed his resignation in order to allow his old academic colleague to participate in the 2013 Conclave.",
    "\nAs Jansen pointed out, and Maike Hickson quoted in a piece for One Peter Five,\nCardinal Kasper barely even made it into the last conclave, because he had just turned 80 years of age.",
    "\nBut since the date of the death (or abdication, as it was the case in 2013) of the pope is decisive, he was still able to attend and vote in that election.",
    "\n(As some observers noted, it was a generous gesture toward Cardinal Kasper that Pope Benedict XVI had decided to retire in due time.)",
    "\nExcuse me Maike, but I don\u2019t think this is a parenthetical issue.",
    "\nIs it any wonder that so many Catholics have become disaffected?",
    "\nCardinal Ratzinger, Pope \u201cEmeritus\u201d Benedict \u2013 whatever you want to call yourself \u2013 I have one question that I would really like you to answer: Why is this man still a cardinal?",
    "\nWhy is he still a bishop?",
    "\nWhy is he still allowed to call himself a \u201cCatholic theologian\u201d?",

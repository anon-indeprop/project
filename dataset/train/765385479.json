Glenn Greenwald Best Price: $1.49 Buy New $3.70 (as of 06:30 EDT - Details)\nIn its revelations of fraudulent wars (Afghanistan, Iraq) and the bald-faced lies of governments (the Chagos Islands), WikiLeaks has allowed us to glimpse how the imperial game is played in the 21st century.",

    "\nThe prime minister of Australia was then Julia Gillard, a Labor Party politician who had declared WikiLeaks \u201cillegal\u201d and wanted to cancel Assange\u2019s passport \u2014 until she was told she could not do this: that Assange had committed no crime: that WikiLeaks was a publisher, whose work was protected under Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to which Australia was one of the original signatories.",

    "\nGillard has recently been appearing in a gig with Hillary Clinton; they are billed as pioneering feminists.",

    "Archbishop Vigan\u00f2 Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic\n\nIn his eleven-page account, affirmed under oath, the Archbishop, marking a turning point in Church history, declares that senior Vatican officials, including former Secretaries of State Angelo Sodano and Tarcisio Bertone as well as Cardinal \u00d3scar Andr\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez Maradiaga, coordinator of Pope Bergoglio\u2019s \u201cCouncil of Cardinals\u201d, covered up McCarrick\u2019s decades of sexual predation and that Bergoglio himself continued the coverup.",
    "\nThis article was first written to address the neo-Catholic commentator Massimo Faggioli\u2019s attempt , following the Pennsylvania grand jury report and the fall of ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, to minimize the homosexual crisis in the Church and blunt the correlative rise of what he derides as \u201cneo-traditionalism.\u201d As my piece was about to go to press, however, EWTN\u2019s National Catholic Register broke the explosive story on the written testimony of Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2 , former apostolic nuncio to the United States (2011 to 2016).",
    "\nFaggioli\u2019s propaganda piece now becomes merely illustrative of the points to be made here in light of this astonishing and indeed providential development.",
    "\nRegarding Bergoglio, Vigan\u00f2 testifies that in 2013 he personally informed him about McCarrick\u2019s history, the dossier of the Congregation for Bishops on his sexual crimes against boys and young men, and the disciplinary sanctions imposed upon him by Benedict XVI (forbidding residence in a seminary, public appearances and Masses).",
    "\nEvidently already aware of these facts, however, Bergoglio not only rehabilitated McCarrick but made him a \u201ctrusted counselor\u201d who advised the elevation of the pro-homosexual prelates Blase Cupich, Joseph Tobin and Kevin Farrell to the College of Cardinals and the prominent episcopal sees they now discredit.",
    "\nAll of this happened before Bergoglio, bowing to worldwide public pressure, finally\u2014only weeks ago\u2014took decisive action against his \u201ctrusted counselor.\u201d McCarrick had lobbied for Bergoglio\u2019s election, along with Maradiaga and the infamous Cardinal Danneels, who covered up homosexual rape committed by a priest against his own nephew,has supported \u201csame-sex marriage,\u201d and advised the King of Belgium to sign a law legalizing abortion in 1990.",
    "\nAs Edward Pentin notes: \u201call 3 prelates have since been special advisors of Francis or rehabilitated by him.\u201d\nVigan\u00f2 concludes his testimony by declaring that all of the prelates involved (many others are implicated), including Bergoglio, should resign their offices for the good of the Church.",
    "\nAs to Bergoglio in particular, he courageously states openly the truth that so many of his brethren know but fear to speak in public:\nI want to recall this indefectible truth of the Church\u2019s holiness to the many people who have been so deeply scandalized by the abominable and sacrilegious behavior of the former Archbishop of Washington, Theodore McCarrick; by the grave, disconcerting and sinful conduct of Pope Francis and by the conspiracy of silence of so many pastors, and who are tempted to abandon the Church, disfigured by so many ignominies.",
    "\nAt the Angelus on Sunday, August 12, 2018 Pope Francis said these words: \u201cEveryone is guilty for the good he could have done and did not do ...",
    "\nIf we do not oppose evil, we tacitly feed it.",
    "\nWe need to intervene where evil is spreading; for evil spreads where daring Christians who oppose evil with good are lacking.\u201d [emphasis in original] If this is rightly to be considered a serious moral responsibility for every believer, how much graver is it for the Church\u2019s supreme pastor, who in the case of McCarrick not only did not oppose evil but associated himself in doing evil with someone he knew to be deeply corrupt.",
    "\nHe followed the advice of someone he knew well to be a pervert, thus multiplying exponentially with his supreme authority the evil done by McCarrick.",
    "\nAnd how many other evil pastors is Francis still continuing to prop up in their active destruction of the Church!",
    "\n[my emphasis] Francis is abdicating the mandate which Christ gave to Peter to confirm the brethren.",
    "\nIndeed, by his action he has divided them, led them into error, and encouraged the wolves to continue to tear apart the sheep of Christ\u2019s flock.",
    "\nIn this extremely dramatic moment for the universal Church, he must acknowledge his mistakes and, in keeping with the proclaimed principle of zero tolerance, Pope Francis must be the first to set a good example for cardinals and bishops who covered up McCarrick\u2019s abuses and resign along with all of them.",
    "\n[emphasis in original]\nBefore he was papal nuncio in Washington, Vigan\u00f2 headed the Governorate of Vatican City State after having served as Nuncio in Nigeria, a Delegate for the Pontifical Representatives of the Secretary of State of the Holy See and a Member of the Disciplinary Commission of the Roman Curia.",
    "\nIn those capacities he had access to documents and witnesses that corroborate his own firsthand testimony.",
    "\nWith Vigan\u00f2\u2019s testimony, the widespread homosexual infiltration of the post-Vatican II hierarchy, from the top on down, now emerges mountainously into view, never to be buried again.",
    "\nEven before that testimony, however, the fall of McCarrick and the Pennsylvania grand jury report had already presented a Sisyphean task to neo-Catholic apologists for the decrepit Novus Ordo status quo and the ill-starred Council that launched its installation.",
    "\nYet there is little doubt they will continue the same polemic that for nearly sixty years has doggedly defended every one of the ruinous \u201creforms\u201d that have resulted in a debacle without equal in Church history, even considering the Arian crisis of the 4th century.",
    "\nThose \u201creforms\u201d included abandonment of the Vatican\u2019s strict pre-conciliar instruction (1961) that \u201cadvancement to religious vows and ordination should be barred to those who are afflicted with evil tendencies to homosexuality or pederasty, since for them the common life and the priestly ministry would constitute serious dangers.\u201d Today, neo-Catholic commentators, cowed by the demands of political correctness, refuse to state the simple truth that homosexuality is a perversion that precludes ordination as does any other grave psychological disorder.",
    "\nKill the Messenger\nI suspect that not even Vigan\u00f2\u2019s historic testimony will change the neo-Catholic position.",
    "\nQuite the contrary, I would expect the neo-Catholic commentariat either to ignore Vigan\u00f2\u2019s witness, explain away his revelations or, failing that, make every effort to smear the man.",
    "\nThe campaign to discredit Archbishop Vigan\u00f2 began instantaneously on the Catholic left wing.",
    "\nOnly hours after Vigan\u00f2\u2019s sworn testimony appeared online, the professional Catholic dissident Sean Michael Winters, writing for National Catholic Reporter, smeared the former Apostolic Nuncio to the United States, who holds doctorates in both civil and canon law, as \u201ca trafficker in conspiracy theories who mixes fact, fiction and venom,\u201d \u201cmore than a little obsessed with homosexuality\u201d\u2014like Oliver Stone, who \u201cwas obsessed with the grassy knoll\u201d\u2014\u201ca disgruntled former employee\u201d and \u201calways a crackpot.\u201d Without addressing the merits, Winters dismissed Archbishop Vigan\u00f2\u2019s \u201cwild claims\u201d about bishops who are \u201csubverting Catholic doctrine on homosexuality\u201d and accused the Archbishop, along with unnamed other bishops and archbishops, of \u201cspeak[ing] about gay people with such hatred\u2026\u201d\nWinters issues the dire warning that \u201cA putsch is afoot and if the U.S. bishops do not, as a body, stand up to defend the Holy Father in the next 24 hours, we shall be slipping towards schism long before the bishops\u2019 meeting in November.",
    "\nThe enemies of Francis have declared war.\u201d Notice that for Winters it is not the Church or the integrity of her doctrine and discipline that must be defended against enemies, but only Bergoglio and the regime of novelty he is leading to its final extremity.",
    "\nJohn Allen\u2019s instant analysis attempting to impeach Vigan\u00f2\u2019s testimony is, as one would expect from him, a bit craftier.",
    "\nHis opinion is: \u201cTake it seriously, but with a large grain of salt.\u201d Which is just Allen\u2019s more nuanced way of saying: \u201cDon\u2019t believe it.\u201d Allen\u2019s view is supported by such irrelevancies as the fact that Vigan\u00f2\u2019s account implicates \u201cno fewer than 32 senior churchmen\u201d (so what?",
    "\n), that he \u201chas a history\u201d of \u201cinnuendo and conspiracy theories\u201d (a gratuitous assertion unsupported by evidence of falsity), that he allegedly quashed an investigation of Archbishop John Nienstedt and ordered evidence destroyed (an allegation Vigan\u00f2 has immediately and categorically denied with conclusive supporting documents, but in any event a tuo quoque fallacy) and that Allen has \u201cthe impression that all this was orchestrated with a political agenda in mind\u201d (the same \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d mentality he gratuitously attributes to Vigan\u00f2).",
    "\nMark Shea, easily the most insufferable of the neo-Catholic polemicists, has quickly followed Winters and Allen in trying to cast doubt on Vigan\u00f2 \u2019s claims.",
    "\nIgnoring eleven pages of detail, written and published under oath, he suggests there has been no \u201cDocumentation.",
    "\nEvidence.",
    "\nProof.\u201d Yes, Francis should resign if Vigan\u00f2 \u2019s allegations are true, Shea admits\u2014a stunning concession coming from him.",
    "\nYet, making no attempt to refute Vigan\u00f2\u2019s account on the merits, he tries to wave it all aside with his usual mode of argument\u2014puerile mockery: \u201cBut at present, the eagerness of the Greatest Catholics of All Time to believe and repeat everything their itching ears want to hear about this Pope whose living guts they have hated from the moment of his election only tells in his favor, not against it.\u201d Shea\u2019s ever-expanding opus of digital invective never seems to rise above this sort of crude ad hominem attack: Well, if those people believe it, it can\u2019t be true.",
    "\nThe neo-Catholic propaganda mill will have a very difficult time smearing this witness, however.",
    "\nSpeaking to Catholic News Agency, Monsignor Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lantheaume, who served as first Counsellor of the Nunciature in Washington, confirmed that \u201cVigan\u00f2 said the truth.",
    "\nThat\u2019s all,\u201d when he stated in his sworn account that Nuncio Pietro Sambi conveyed to McCarrick at the Nunciature in Washington the sanctions that had been imposed on him by Pope Benedict\u2014sanctions Bergoglio ignored for five years until forced to act by a worldwide storm of outrage.",
    "\nFurthermore, a series of prelates has vouched for Vigan\u00f2\u2019s character and credibility:\n- Bishop Joseph Strickland of Tyler, Texas has gone so far as to order all the priests in his diocese to read from the pulpit a statement that he finds Vigan\u00f2\u2019s allegations credible.",
    "\n- Bishop Thomas Olmsted of Phoenix, Arizona, issued a statement affirming that he has known Vigan\u00f2 for 39 years, has \u201calways known and respected him as a man of truthfulness, faith and integrity\u201d and that his testimony should \u201cbe taken seriously by all\u2026\u201d\n- Archbishop Allen Vigneron of Detroit, Michigan issued a statement calling Vigan\u00f2\u2019s account \u201canother daunting challenge to our confidence in the reliability of the Church\u2019s leadership, during a summer of devastating news regarding clergy sexual abuse and infidelity.\u201d (The statement has since apparently been scrubbed from the diocesan website.)",
    "\n- Bishop Athanasius Schneider declares: \u201cArchbishop Vigan\u00f2 confirmed his statement by a sacred oath invoking the name of God.",
    "\nThere is, therefore, no reasonable and plausible cause to doubt the truth content of the document of Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2.\u201d\n- Cardinal Raymond Burke\u2019s statement declares: \u201cThe declarations made by a prelate of the authority of Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2 must be totally taken to heart by those responsible in the Church.\u201d\n- [And just two days ago, Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone of San Francisco wrote a letter to his faithful which \"speaks to Vigano's integrity and sincere love of the Church.\"]",
    "\nIn another setback for the propaganda machine gearing up to impeach Vigan\u00f2\u2019s testimony, the Catholic Herald has just reported that Cardinal Wuerl must have known full well from Vigan\u00f2 himself that McCarrick was under Pope Benedict\u2019s papal sanctions on account of his sexual misconduct because, as an Archdiocesan spokesman now confirms, at Vigan\u00f2\u2019s request as then papal nuncio Wuerl had to cancel a public appearance by McCarrick not long before Bergoglio\u2019s election.",
    "\nThe Herald asks the obvious question: \u201c[I]f Cardinal Wuerl was unaware of the sanctions, and unaware of the reason for them, why did he ask no questions of the nuncio regarding the reason for his demand?\u201d The question answers itself, and Vigan\u00f2\u2019s testimony on this critical point stands confirmed by Wuerl\u2019s own spokesman.",
    "\nBergoglio Pleads the Fifth\nBergoglio himself, however, has already precluded any attempt to impeach Vigan\u00f2\u2019s testimony.",
    "\nDuring the return flight from Dublin after the \u201cWorld Meeting of Familes,\u201d he was asked to comment on Vigan\u00f2 \u2019s allegations that he had informed Bergoglio of McCarrick\u2019s crimes in 2013 as well as the sanctions imposed by Benedict.",
    "\nBergoglio declined to incriminate himself:\nRead the statement carefully yourselves and make your own judgment.",
    "\nI am not going to say a word about this.",
    "\nI believe that the statement speaks for itself, and you all have sufficient journalistic ability to draw conclusions.",
    "\nIt is an act of trust.",
    "\nWhen a little time goes by, and you have drawn conclusions, perhaps I will speak about it, but I would like your professional maturity to do this work.",
    "\nIt will do you all good, really.",
    "\nIn other words, as Bergoglio cannot deny the allegations without lying, he will say nothing at all about them in the hope they will go away\u2014with the help of sycophants in the Vatican press corps and shifty polemicists like Shea, who expects his readers to swallow his explanation that Bergoglio\u2019s refusal to say anything in his defense when asked point blank about the charges against him \u201cseems to me to obviously be the reply of somebody who believes the accusations are groundless\u2026\u201d.",
    "\nSeems to be.",
    "\nObviously.",
    "\nThe American \u201cGay\u201d Church Expansion\nWhile events have overtaken Faggioli\u2019s piece, it will remain useful here as a prime example of the neo-Catholic polemic.",
    "\nThat polemic seeks to shore up the collapsing Novus Ordo establishment lest it give way to the dreaded traditionalist revival.",
    "\nBut before I address Faggioli\u2019s latest defense of the indefensible, some background is in order, including a discussion of further key details of Vigan\u00f2\u2019s testimony.",
    "\nFirst of all, as I predicted 16 years ago, because the Vatican under John Paul II had no intention of enforcing the pre-conciliar ban on admission of homosexuals to the seminary \u201ca new bumper crop of homosexual ordinands is guaranteed\u2014and with it a new harvest of scandal for the Church.\u201d That prediction came immediately after the \u201cpedophile summit\u201d of 2002 in Rome, which I attended as The Remnant\u2019s correspondent.",
    "\nIn answer to my question then head of the USCCB, Wilton Gregory, made an explosive admission reportedby the international press: \u201cit is an ongoing struggle to make sure that the Catholic priesthood is not dominated by homosexual men.\u201d The struggle, to the extent there even was one, obviously has been lost.",
    "\nSixteen years later, the homosexual predator McCarrick has finally been exposed to the world, stripped of his cardinal\u2019s hat and deprived of any ministry, but only after international media coverage of the Vatican\u2019s semi-secret finding that McCarrick had raped a teenage altar boy 47 years ago.",
    "\nIf not for that one case, McCarrick\u2019s sixty years of homosexual debauchery might well have gone unpunished in this world and he would have died still possessed of all the phony honors that had been heaped upon him throughout his career as a parasite in the Body of Christ, including the favor shown to him by Bergoglio.",
    "\nThe telling details of Archbishop Vigan\u00f2\u2019s testimony concerning Bergoglio\u2019s friendly relations with McCarrick before he finally had to cut him loose\u2014details conveniently ignored by Winters, Allen and Shea\u2014are utterly devastating to any defense of Bergoglio.",
    "\nThis would explain why he will not a \u201csay a word about\u201d Vigan\u00f2\u2019s charges against him.",
    "\nThe Archbishop reveals, as already noted, that Pope Benedict imposed sanctions on McCarrick under which he \u201cwas to leave the seminary where he was living, he was forbidden to celebrate [Mass] in public, to participate in public meetings, to give lectures, to travel, with the obligation of dedicating himself to a life of prayer and penance.\u201d Vigan\u00f2 further reveals that those sanctions were communicated to McCarrick by then Apostolic Nuncio to the United States, Pietro Sambi, but were also repeated by Vigan\u00f2 himself when he succeeded Sambi as Nuncio:\nI repeated them to Cardinal McCarrick at my first meeting with him at the Nunciature.",
    "\nThe Cardinal, muttering in a barely comprehensible way, admitted that he had perhaps made the mistake of sleeping in the same bed with some seminarians at his beach house, but he said this as if it had no importance.",
    "\nVigan\u00f2 testifies that on June 23, 2013, he obtained a private audience with Bergoglio after having encountered McCarrick at the Pope\u2019s residence three days earlier, during which encounter McCarrick had told him with an air of triumph: \u201cThe Pope received me yesterday, tomorrow I am going to China\u201d (evidently to assist in negotiating Bergoglio\u2019s planned sellout of China\u2019s underground Catholics to the Communist dictators of Beijing).",
    "\nVigan\u00f2 wanted to know why McCarrick had apparently been relieved of the sanctions.",
    "\nDuring the audience Bergoglio queried: \u201cWhat is Cardinal McCarrick like?\u201d and Vigan\u00f2 replied with the truth Bergoglio obviously did not want to hear:\nI answered him with complete frankness and, if you want, with great naivet\u00e9: \u201cHoly Father, I don\u2019t know if you know Cardinal McCarrick, but if you ask the Congregation for Bishops there is a dossier this thick about him.",
    "\nHe corrupted generations of seminarians and priests and Pope Benedict ordered him to withdraw to a life of prayer and penance.\u201d The Pope did not make the slightest comment about those very grave words of mine and did not show any expression of surprise on his face, as if he had already known the matter for some time, and he immediately changed the subject.",
    "\nBut then, what was the Pope\u2019s purpose in asking me that question: \u201cWhat is Cardinal McCarrick like?\u201d He clearly wanted to find out if I was an ally of McCarrick or not\u2026.",
    "\nIt was also clear that, from the time of Pope Francis\u2019s election, McCarrick, now free from all constraints, had felt free to travel continuously, to give lectures and interviews\u2026.",
    "\nHe [Bergoglio] knew from at least June 23, 2013 [the date of the audience with Vigan\u00f2] that McCarrick was a serial predator.",
    "\nAlthough he knew that he was a corrupt man, he covered for him to the bitter end; indeed, he made McCarrick\u2019s advice his own, which was certainly not inspired by sound intentions and for love of the Church.",
    "\nIt was only when he was forced by the report of the abuse of a minor, again on the basis of media attention, that he took action to save his image in the media.",
    "\n[all emphasis in original]\nBefore his long overdue fall McCarrick, as Bergoglio\u2019s \u201ctrusted counselor,\u201d had been instrumental in cementing into place the homosexual-friendly status quo of the American episcopate that oppresses and defrauds the faithful.",
    "\nIt was McCarrick, noted Marco Tosatti, who was behind the elevation of Blase Cupich to the key position of Archbishop of Chicago, where Cupich has since promoted the homosexual subversion of Father James Martin.",
    "\nAnd Vigan\u00f2 now confirms Tosatti\u2019s allegation: \u201cThe appointments of Blase Cupich to Chicago and Joseph W. Tobin to Newark were orchestrated by McCarrick, Maradiaga and Wuerl, united by a wicked pact of abuses by the first, and at least of coverup of abuses by the other two.",
    "\nTheir names were not among those presented by the Nunciature for Chicago and Newark.\u201d That is, the normal process was circumvented for these appointments.",
    "\nRemnant readers may recall that I spotted Cupich back in 2002, when he was the obscure Bishop of Rapid City, South Dakota, as an example of what was coming in the Novus Ordo: accelerated degeneration.",
    "\nAs I wrote back then, with the likes of Cupich in view:\nCupich is the very model of a Novus Ordo bishop.",
    "\nHe is the very exemplar of the crisis we must still endure\u2026.",
    "\nLet the thing die of its own excesses, for as the \u201clittle synod\u201d [the 2002 \u201cpedophile summit\u201d] demonstrates, the men who control this establishment will never restore it to anything resembling the vibrant Church that a long line of militant, uncompromising Popes delivered into their hands at Vatican II.",
    "\nFor heaven\u2019s sake, the men who govern the Church today require a Vatican summit meeting to agonize over whether serial child molesters should be defrocked.",
    "\nFrom the Vatican on down, through deliberate decisions and criminal neglect, the servitors of Vatican II have laid waste to the liturgy, the perennial clarity of Catholic teaching, the Church\u2019s militant opposition to worldly thinking, the traditional formation in seminaries, the religious orders, the missions, the trust of the faithful in their own priests\u2014in short, the very life of the Church\u2014and dare to call it a renewal.",
    "\nWe must no longer subsidize the malpractice of the architects of ruin.",
    "\nNor must we join the neo-Catholics in their mindless applause when one of these incompetents attempts to repoint a brick or two in the crumbling fa\u00e7ade they have erected to obscure the Church of old.",
    "\nAs for William (\u201cnighty-night baby!\u201d) Tobin, after McCarrick had arranged for him to become Archbishop of Newark, Tobin, another episcopal booster of Martin\u2019s pro-homosexual propaganda, promptly sponsored a \u201cgay pilgrimage\u201d to his cathedral in Newark.",
    "\nAnd it was McCarrick who obtained the cardinal\u2019s hat for his roommate of six years, Kevin Farrell, whom he consecrated a bishop.",
    "\nFarrell, yet another promoter of Martin\u2019s homosexual activism, arranged for Martin to \u201cwelcome \u2018gay\u2019 families\u201d at the \u201cWorld Meeting of Families\u201d in Dublin from which Bergoglio has just returned.",
    "\nFinally, there is the appointment of the \u201cpro-gay\u201d Robert McElroy as Bishop of San Diego, concerning which Vigan\u00f2 reveals: \u201cThe appointment of McElroy in San Diego was also orchestrated from above, with an encrypted peremptory order to me as Nuncio, by Cardinal Parolin: \u2018Reserve the See of San Diego for McElroy.\u2019 McElroy was also well aware of McCarrick\u2019s abuses, as can be seen from a letter sent to him by Richard Sipe on July 28, 2016.\u201d Like Cupich, Tobin and Farrell, McElroy is an avid promoter of Martin\u2019s homosexual subversion of the Church, calling opposition to Martin symptomatic of a \u201ccancer of vilification [that] is seeping into the institutional life of the church.\u201d\nEmboldened by the certainty that he will face no discipline whatsoever, Martin, now backed by \u201cCupich, Tobin, Farrell and McElroy,\u201d as Vigan\u00f2 testifies, is urging all the \u201cgay priests\u201d to \u201ccome out,\u201d including those ordained since the useless \u201cpedophile summit\u201d presided over by none other than McCarrick as the classic fox in charge of the hen house.",
    "\nBut Bergoglio has also lent his own authority to Martin\u2019s effort to mainstream homosexuality in the Church.",
    "\nAs Vigan\u00f2 notes, it was Bergoglio who made Martin a \u201cConsultor of the Secretariat for Communications,\u201d even though he is a \u201cwell-known activist who promotes the LGBT agenda, chosen to corrupt the young people who will soon gather in Dublin for the World Meeting of Families\u2026\u201d\n\u201cFather\u201d Martin now confidently declares, sixteen years after the \u201cpedophile summit,\u201d that \u201cThe idea of a purge of gay priests is both ridiculous and dangerous.",
    "\nAny purge would empty parishes and religious orders of the thousands of priests and bishops who lead healthy lives of service and faithful lives of celibacy.\u201d\nMartin thus revels in smug certitude that the future of the universal Church is in the hands of legions of intrinsically disordered homosexual bishops and priests and their homosexual successors, who will perpetuate an existing worldwide homosexual network, and that there is absolutely nothing we can or should do about it.",
    "\nA Worldwide Network of Corruption, Beginning at the Top\nNone of the foregoing is meant to suggest that the homosexual invasion of the Catholic hierarchy is confined to American prelates and priests.",
    "\nThe spread of clerical sodomy has not respected national boundaries but rather extends throughout the Church under the eyes of a Vatican apparatus that is itself thoroughly infested with homosexuals.",
    "\nThis is thanks in large measure to Bergoglio, who made a flagrantly active homosexual, Monsignor Battista Ricca, \u201cprelate of the gay lobby,\u201d no less than head of his papal household.",
    "\nMoreover, it was Bergoglio\u2019s right hand man, Cardinal Maradiaga, who sheltered his friend, Juan Jos\u00e9 Pineda, auxiliary Bishop of Tegucigalpa, from any discipline over his notorious homosexual liaisons with seminarians in that diocese.",
    "\nWhen an apostolic visitation, compelled by mounting public pressure, confirmed the charges against Pineda, he was forced to resign, even as Maradiaga dismissed the incontestable proofs against him as \u201cslander.\u201d Vigan\u00f2 notes that \u201cthe only thing that has been made public is that his resignation has simply been accepted, thus making any possible responsibility of his and Maradiaga vanish into nowhere.\u201d\nDespite the fall of his friend Pineda, Maradiaga continues todefend and protect the homosexual corruption of his own seminary, involving incontrovertible evidence of rampant sodomy among the seminarians he refuses to dismiss, rejecting all the evidence as \u201cgossip.\u201d Concerning Maradiaga, who is also mired in financial corruption for which he offers no credible explanation, Vigan\u00f2 provides this withering assessment of the man and his relation to Bergoglio:\nIn a team effort with Cardinal Rodriguez Maradiaga, [McCarrick] had become the kingmaker for appointments in the Curia and the United States, and the most listened to advisor in the Vatican for relations with the Obama administration.",
    "\nThis is how one explains that, as members of the Congregation for Bishops, the Pope replaced Cardinal Burke with Wuerl and immediately appointed Cupich right after he was made a cardinal.",
    "\nWith these appointments the Nunciature in Washington was now out of the picture in the appointment of bishops\u2026.. By now the faithful have well understood Maradiaga\u2019s strategy: insult the victims to save himself, lie to the bitter end to cover up a chasm of abuses of power, of mismanagement in the administration of Church property, and of financial disasters even against close friends, as in the case of the Ambassador of Honduras Alejandro Valladares, former Dean of the Diplomatic Corps to the Holy See\u2026.",
    "\nThe Pope defends his man, Cardinal Rodriguez Maradiaga, to the bitter end, as he had done in Chile with Bishop Juan de la Cruz Barros, whom he himself had appointed Bishop of Osorno against the advice of the Chilean Bishops.",
    "\nFirst, he insulted the abuse victims.",
    "\nThen, only when he was forced by the media, and a revolt by the Chilean victims and faithful, did he recognize his error and apologize, while stating that he had been misinformed, causing a disastrous situation for the Church in Chile, but continuing to protect the two Chilean Cardinals Errazuriz and Ezzati.",
    "\nOn the very day Archbishop Vigan\u00f2\u2019s testimony was made public, Sandro Magister summed up the entire state of affairs in the Church universal after decades of unrestricted homosexual migration into the hierarchy, to which Bergoglio has contributed mightily: \u201cFrom the seminaries, to the clergy, to the bishops, to the cardinals, homosexuals are present at all levels, by the thousand.\u201d\nArchbishop Vigan\u00f2 now provides his own decisive summary of the situation, based on firsthand experience with a now endemic homosexual corruption of the Church:\nJanet Smith, Professor of Moral Theology at the Sacred Heart Major Seminary in Detroit, recently wrote: \u201cThe problem of clergy abuse cannot be resolved simply by the resignation of some bishops, and even less so by bureaucratic directives.",
    "\nThe deeper problem lies in homosexual networks within the clergy which must be eradicated.\u201d These homosexual networks, which are now widespread in many dioceses, seminaries, religious orders, etc., act under the concealment of secrecy and lies with the power of octopus tentacles, and strangle innocent victims and priestly vocations, and are strangling the entire Church.",
    "\n[emphasis added]\nDefending the Council by Defending the Homosexual Status Quo\nAt this moment, the entire Novus Ordo regime of novelty is threatened with collapse on account of its homosexual corruption, and voices throughout the Catholic world are now echoing Archbishop Vigan\u00f2\u2019s call for Bergoglio\u2019s resignation, including Laura Ingraham: \u201cToo little, too late from Pope Francis in Ireland.",
    "\nI stand with Archbishop Carlo Vigano.",
    "\nTime for the laity to demand a new Shepherd.\u201d Even Michael Voris, in a highly amusing example of leading from behind, has finally abandoned his absurd refusal to criticize this pontificate and now declares with a screaming headline: \u201cPope Francis Must Resign.\u201d\nNearly three years ago, seeing what was certainly coming on the disastrous course Bergoglio had already clearly established, this newspaper published a petition which states: \u201cWe your subjects respectfully petition Your Holiness to change course for the good of the Church and the welfare of souls.",
    "\nFailing this, would it not be better for Your Holiness to renounce the Petrine office than to preside over what threatens to be a catastrophic compromise of the Church\u2019s integrity?\u201d Our petition was of course dismissed as \u201cridiculous\u201d by the neo-Catholic commentariat.",
    "\nToday, our ridiculous suggestion is the stuff of mainstream news.",
    "\nFrom the neo-Catholic perspective, the events of recent days present a terrifying prospect: the final collapse of the Novus Ordo establishment, an end to the conciliar aggiornamento and a revival of integral Tradition, which growing numbers of young people are seeking.",
    "\nHence even before Archbishop Vigan\u00f2 had come forward, commentators like Faggioli were already sounding the neo-Catholic air raid siren.",
    "\nFaggioli fretted that \u201c[t]he abuse scandal and delegitimization of the episcopate has created a great power vacuum in the Church\u201d that could be filled by the \u201cneo-traditionalist Catholicism of the younger generations of American Catholics\u201d who \u201cattack American bishops and cardinals close to Pope Francis.\u201d Accordingly, he rushed to the defense of Bergoglio and his corrupt regime against \u201ca radicalization of religious conservatism in the neo-traditionalism sense...\u201d\nFor Faggioli, not only would Bergoglio\u2019s resignation be unthinkable, so also would a purge of the homosexual and pro-homosexual prelates Bergoglio and his Vatican henchmen have systematically enabled.",
    "\nThe Pope, he argues, is not \u201cthe CEO of the Catholic Church world, and the bishops as its managers whom the Pope can simply fire.\u201d No, Bergoglio cannot \u201csimply fire\u201d bishops.",
    "\nExcept whenever he pleases, as we have seen again and again with the conservative bishops and even Cardinals (Burke and M\u00fcller) he has sacked because their conservatism offended him or one of his friends, prompting even Crux to ask: \u201cDoes Pope Francis have an enemies list?\u201d Then again, Francis even obtained the removal of his own \u201ctrusted counselor\u201d McCarrick from the College of Cardinals, albeit only when forced to act due to worldwide condemnation in the media.",
    "\nSo, according to Faggioli, the same Pope who sacks conservative bishops and cardinals according to his pleasure and has just removed a cardinal from the College of Cardinals in an unprecedented disciplinary act under fire from the media, is somehow powerless to dismiss Modernist bishops who have created an obscene \u201cgay culture\u201d in the Church and replace them with orthodox, normal heterosexual males.",
    "\nFrancis cannot \u201csimply fire\u201d even Cardinal Wuerl, who covered up crimes of homosexual predation by the priests he transferred elsewhere while Archbishop of Pittsburgh, and who authorized payment of $900,000 in hush money to bury sexual abuse claims against a homosexual priest involved in the production of child pornography.",
    "\nWuerl, says Faggioli, \u201cfaces a complex situation: on the one hand Wuerl was not afraid of clashing with the tribunal over the Apostolic Signatura in the Vatican which wanted to readmit a priest from the Pittsburgh diocese to ministry\u2026 while in other cases he seems to have collaborated in covering up some cases\u2026 It is a very difficult position also because Wuerl became a symbol\u2026 beyond the specific accusations against him, from which he could not publicly defend himself.\u201d\nIn other words, because his situation is \u201ccomplex\u201d Wuerl, unlike McCarrick, should remain a cardinal and the Archbishop of Washington, DC, thus maintaining a key bulwark against the \u201cneo-traditionalist\u201d threat.",
    "\nYet, as the Pennsylvania grand jury report documents, Wuerl assisted McCarrick in the coverup of his crimes and now brazenly lies about it.",
    "\nHere too Vigan\u00f2\u2019s testimony sheds light on the darkness:\n\u2026.",
    "\nI myself brought up the subject [of McCarrick] with Cardinal Wuerl on several occasions, and I certainly didn\u2019t need to go into detail because it was immediately clear to me that he was fully aware of it.",
    "\nI also remember in particular the fact that I had to draw his attention to it, because I realized that in an archdiocesan publication, on the back cover in color, there was an announcement inviting young men who thought they had a vocation to the priesthood to a meeting with Cardinal McCarrick.",
    "\nI immediately phoned Cardinal Wuerl, who expressed his surprise to me, telling me that he knew nothing about that announcement and that he would cancel it.",
    "\nIf, as he now continues to state, he knew nothing of the abuses committed by McCarrick and the measures taken by Pope Benedict, how can his answer be explained?",
    "\nHis recent statements that he knew nothing about it, even though at first he cunningly referred to compensation for the two victims, are absolutely laughable.",
    "\nThe Cardinal lies shamelessly and prevails upon his Chancellor, Monsignor Antonicelli, to lie as well.",
    "\nCardinal Wuerl also clearly lied on another occasion.",
    "\nFollowing a morally unacceptable event authorized by the academic authorities of Georgetown University, I brought it to the attention of its President, Dr. John DeGioia, sending him two subsequent letters.",
    "\nBefore forwarding them to the addressee, so as to handle things properly, I personally gave a copy of them to the Cardinal with an accompanying letter I had written.",
    "\nThe Cardinal told me that he knew nothing about it.",
    "\nHowever, he failed to acknowledge receipt of my two letters, contrary to what he customarily did.",
    "\nI subsequently learned that the event at Georgetown had taken place for seven years.",
    "\nBut the Cardinal knew nothing about it!",
    "\nCardinal Wuerl, well aware of the continuous abuses committed by Cardinal McCarrick and the sanctions imposed on him by Pope Benedict, transgressing the Pope\u2019s order, also allowed him to reside at a seminary in Washington D.C.",
    "\nIn doing so, he put other seminarians at risk.",
    "\n[emphasis in original]\nWhat really concerns Faggioli and those who think like him is not Wuerl and his \u201ccomplex situation,\u201d which is not complex at all.",
    "\nRather, what he views with alarm as an \u201cessential element\u201d of the context in which Wuerl operates is that \u201cscandals are also the opportunity for the neo-traditionalist Catholicism of the younger generations of American Catholics to attack American bishops and cardinals close to Pope Francis\u2026.\u201d Better a thousand septuagenarian Wuerls in their lavish sties of corruption, financed by the faithful, than a single, young neo-traditionalist prelate!",
    "\nBut what exactly is a neo-traditionalist?",
    "\nQuite simply: an orthodox Catholic who has had enough of the homosexual-infested regime of novelty imposed on the Church by the old men of the Council, Bergoglio merely being the latest, the highest placed, and one of the last.",
    "\nAs Faggioli puts it: \u201cIn the last fifteen years, the American Catholic Church has been traversed by a radicalization of religious conservatism in the neo-traditionalism sense, especially in the younger generations of priests and intellectuals.",
    "\nThey interpret the current abuse crisis as fruit of the mistakes of the Council itself and not only of the post-Council\u2026\u201d\nJust as Faggioli fears, many in the up-and-coming generation of Catholic clergy and laity recognize the obvious: that the conciliar texts, for all their prolix repetition of traditional teaching, opened the way to ecclesial disaster.",
    "\nBecause in those texts\u2014above all Gaudium et Spes, Dignitatis Humanae, Unitatis Redintegratio, Nostra Aetate and Sacrosanctum Concilium\u2014the Council verbally prostrated itself before \u201cthe modern world\u201d and the practitioners of other religions while authorizing Bugnini (Secretary of the liturgical Preparatory Commission that drafted what would become Sacrosanctum Concilium) to begin demolition of the sacred liturgy that was the very foundation Catholic of orthodoxy and orthopraxis.",
    "\nTo quote Paul VI, then in the depths of his conciliar delirium at the Council\u2019s close:\nBut one must realize that this council, which exposed itself to human judgment, insisted very much more upon this pleasant side of man, rather than on his unpleasant one.",
    "\nIts attitude was very much and deliberately optimistic.",
    "\nA wave of affection and admiration flowed from the council over the modern world of humanity\u2026.",
    "\nInstead of depressing diagnoses, encouraging remedies; instead of direful prognostics, messages of trust issued from the council to the present-day world.",
    "\nThe modern world\u2019s values were not only respected but honored, its efforts approved, its aspirations purified and blessed.",
    "\n[emphasis added]\nThus did Paul describe the conciliar \u201copening to the world\u201d through which the world promptly invaded the Church, including large numbers of homosexuals who should never have been admitted to the seminary.",
    "\nIn sum, Faggioli is representative of the thinking that requires defense of a homosexualized clergy if only for the reason that tradition-minded Catholics cannot be allowed to take their place: \u201cThis neo-traditionalist Catholicism believes that sexual abuses are committed only by homosexual clergy\u2026 and that the crisis of abuse can be resolved by a kind of Catholic Jacobinism that should eliminate all bishops and priests minimally engaged in dialogue with modern culture, and replaced by a young clergy marked by personal sanctity but also by a fascination for a mythical Middle Ages and the rejection of a Church-world relationship based on a principle of reality.\u201d\nRather than \u201cyoung clergy marked by personal sanctity,\u201d the neo-Catholic mentality Faggioli exemplifies prefers that homosexual priests and bishops be kept in place in order to continue the \u201cdialogue with modern culture.\u201d It is not the integrity of the Faith that matters but only perpetuation of the post-conciliar regime of novelty.",
    "\nAny abandonment of the regime must be viewed as ecclesiastical treason\u2014\u201cCatholic Jacobinism\u201d\u2014if not criminal activity.",
    "\nFaggioli would probably be more inclined to civil or criminal prosecution of \u201cCatholic Jacobins\u201d for \u201chate speech\u201d than Novus Ordo bishops for their complicity in covering up homosexual rapes.",
    "\n\u201cHomosexuality in the clergy exists and is a matter that must be addressed,\u201d Faggioli fleetingly acknowledges toward the end of his piece, \u201cbut the abuse crisis cannot be resolved by making homosexuals within the Church the scapegoat of a scandal that has ancient roots, well before Vatican Council II.\u201d And how does the Church \u201caddress\u201d a massive infestation by homosexual priests and prelates without removing them from authority and ensuring that they cannot promote homosexual successors for generation after generation?",
    "\nFaggioli has no answer because what he is really arguing\u2014the final beachhead of the neo-Catholic defense of their disintegrating regime\u2014is that homosexuals in the hierarchy must remain in authority as an indispensable seawall against a \u201cneo-traditionalist\u201d storm surge.",
    "\nFaggioli\u2019s argument demonstrates that neo-Catholicism has never been about making the authentic Faith more appealing to a \u201cmodern world\u201d founded precisely on a rejection of the Church\u2019s authority.",
    "\nIt is not about the Faith at all.",
    "\nRather, it is an ideological movement dedicated to the face-saving defense of a catastrophic failure in ecclesial innovation that has corrupted the human element of the Church in practically every department.",
    "\nFor people like Faggioli, indeed for the tradition-hating Pope they blindly defend, the one thing to be feared is that more and more faithful will recognize the neo-Catholic polemic for what it is\u2014a fraud\u2014and begin demanding a return of everything the regime of novelty has stolen from the life of the Church.",
    "\nThat is exactly what a growing number of Catholics are now doing, as even the secular press recognized less than three months before Bergoglio began his tyrannical reign.",
    "\nIn this respect, what the neo-Catholics are defending at bottom is themselves\u2014that is, the reputations they have all staked on their defense of the indefensible against the traditionalists they have arrogantly mocked and marginalized for decades only to see, to their horror, that traditionalism is ever more vindicated as the scandals of the Novus Ordo mount under this reckless Pope to an unsustainable, indeed apocalyptic, level.",
    "\nA return to integral Tradition is the threat that Faggioli sees as coming particularly from the young.",
    "\nIrony of ironies, he is now reduced to defending what is old and tired and corrupt against a restoration, led largely by a youthful vanguard, of what is ever ancient but ever new.",
    "\nFor some, it seems, no price is too great\u2014not even the good of the Church\u2014to avoid the personal ignominy of being seen on the wrong side of history.",
    "\nConclusion: The Fatima Connection\nLong before the arrival of Bergoglio in Rome, the successive Vatican Secretaries of State, Angelo Sodano and Tarcisio Bertone, were instrumental in advancing the homosexual corruption of the Novus Ordo establishment.",
    "\nAs to Bertone and Sodano, Vigan\u00f2 provides further vital testimony:\nNuncio Sambi\u2019s report [on McCarrick\u2019s sexual abuse], with all the attachments, was sent to Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, as Secretary of State.",
    "\nMy two above-mentioned memos of December 6, 2006 and May 25, 2008, were also presumably handed over to him by the Substitute.",
    "\nAs already mentioned, the Cardinal had no difficulty in insistently presenting for the episcopate candidates known to be active homosexuals \u2014 I cite only the well-known case of Vincenzo de Mauro, who was appointed Archbishop-Bishop of Vigevano and later removed because he was undermining his seminarians \u2014 and in filtering and manipulating the information he conveyed to Pope Benedict\u2026.",
    "\nCardinal Angelo Sodano was Secretary of State until September 2006: all information [concerning McCarrick] was communicated to him.",
    "\nIn November 2000, Nunzio Montalvo sent him his report, passing on to him the aforementioned letter from Father Boniface Ramsey in which he denounced the serious abuses committed by McCarrick.",
    "\nIt is known that Sodano tried to cover up the Father Maciel scandal to the end.",
    "\nHe even removed the Nuncio in Mexico City, Justo Mullor, who refused to be an accomplice in his scheme to cover Maciel, and in his place appointed Sandri, then-Nuncio to Venezuela, who was willing to collaborate in the cover-up.",
    "\nSodano even went so far as to issue a statement to the Vatican press office in which a falsehood was affirmed, that is, that Pope Benedict had decided that the Maciel case should be considered closed.",
    "\nBenedict reacted, despite Sodano\u2019s strenuous defense, and Maciel was found guilty and irrevocably condemned.",
    "\nIt is no coincidence that, as I detail in my book on the Third Secret of Fatima, Sodano and Bertone have also taken the leading role in suppressing the integral Secret and reducing the Message of Fatima in general to a generic prescription for personal piety, stripped of its prophetic and admonitory content regarding the epochal malfeasance and corruption of the upper hierarchy to which they belong.",
    "\nConcerning my book, Archbishop Pietro Sambi, Vigan\u00f2\u2019s predecessor as Nuncio in Washington, whom Vigan\u00f2\u2019 credits with diligently reporting McCarrick\u2019s crimes to the Vatican and conveying Benedict\u2019s sanctions to McCarrick, made some very revealing comments during an interview with Robert Moynihan, published posthumously six years ago in Inside the Vatican:\nWe were discussing the Third Secret of Fatima, the allegations that the Vatican has not published the entire text of the Third Secret as revealed to Sister Lucia, and the response of Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, the Vatican secretary of state, in a book where Bertone states that there is nothing more to be revealed.",
    "\nSambi said, \u201cExcuse me.\u201d He got up, went out of the room, and came back with a book.",
    "\n\u201cHere,\u201d he said.",
    "\n\u201cDo you know this book?",
    "\nYou should read it.\u201d It was Christopher Ferrara's The Secret Still Hidden.",
    "\n\u201cWait,\u201d I said.",
    "\n\u201cYou are the Pope\u2019s representative in the US, and you are urging me to read a book that questions what the secretary of state wrote?\u201d Sambi replied, \u201cAll I am saying is that there are interesting things worth reading in this book.",
    "\nAnd in the end, we are all after the truth, aren\u2019t we?",
    "\nThe truth is the important thing...\u201d\nThe truth is indeed the important thing.",
    "\nAnd the truth about our situation is revealed in that still-hidden part of the Secret to whose contents Pope Benedict alluded during his pilgrimage to Fatima in 2010, identifying elements that do not appear at all in the obscure vision published back in 2000, which Sodano and Bertone tried to pass of as the entirety of the Secret at the same time they were covering up homosexual corruption in high places:\nAs for the new things which we can find in this message today, there is also the fact that attacks on the Pope and the Church come not only from without, but the sufferings of the Church come precisely from within the Church, from the sin existing within the Church.",
    "\nThis too is something that we have always known, but today we are seeing it in a really terrifying way: that the greatest persecution of the Church comes not from her enemies without, but arises from sin within the Church, and that the Church thus has a deep need to relearn penance, to accept purification, to learn forgiveness on the one hand, but also the need for justice.",
    "\n[emphasis added]\nI believe that Archbishop Vigan\u00f2\u2019s precious testimony is a sign that Heaven itself is now responding to the \u201cneed for justice\u201d in the Church.",
    "\nWhether or not justice involves the resignation of the most wayward Pope in Church history, the inevitable season of justice will culminate in the triumph of the Immaculate Heart of Mary and the Church\u2019s restoration.",
    "\nThis will be a final victory over the enemies within and their apologists, such as Faggioli, who, in typical neo-Catholic style, imperiously scoffs at the notion of \u201ca young clergy marked by personal sanctity but also by a fascination for a mythical Middle Ages\u201d and busies himself defending an unsalvageable mass of corruption he dares to describe as \u201ca Church-world relationship based on a principle of reality.\u201d\nI can only conclude by making my own these closing words of Archbishop Vigan\u00f2:"

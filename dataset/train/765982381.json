    "\nIt is as if a one-way moral screen has been pushed back to expose the imperialism of liberal democracies: the commitment to endless warfare \u2026 When Harold Pinter accepted the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2005, he referred to \u2018a vast tapestry of lies up on which we feed.\u2019 He asked why \u2018the systematic brutality, the widespread atrocities, the ruthless suppression of independent thought\u2019 of the Soviet Union were well known in the West while America\u2019s imperial crimes \u201cnever happened \u2026 even while [they] were happening, they never happened.\u2019\u201d\nWikiLeaks and 9/11: What if?",

WikiLeaks Best Price: $2.50 Buy New $7.00 (as of 05:50 EDT - Details)\nFourth Estate on Life Support\nIn 2010, while he was still a free man, the Sam Adams Associates for Integrity gave its annual award to Assange.",
    "\nThe citation read:\n\u201cIt seems altogether fitting and proper that this year\u2019s award be presented in London, where Edmund Burke coined the expression \u201cFourth Estate.\u201d Comparing the function of the press to that of the three Houses then in Parliament, Burke said: \u201c\u2026but in the Reporters Gallery yonder, there sits a Fourth Estate more important far then they all.\u201d The year was 1787\u2014the year the U.S. Constitution was adopted.",
    "\nThe First Amendment, approved four years later, aimed at ensuring that the press would be free of government interference.",

    "\nSmall wonder that governments with lots to hide feel very threatened.",
    "\nIt has been said: \u201cYou shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.\u201d WikiLeaks is helping make that possible by publishing documents that do not lie.",

    "\nBradley Manning gave WikiLeaks the gun-barrel video of July 12, 2007 called \u201cCollateral Murder.\u201d Whoever did provide that graphic footage, showing the brutality of the celebrated \u201csurge\u201d in Iraq, was certainly far more a patriot than the \u201cmainstream\u201d journalist embedded in that same Army unit.",
    "\nHe suppressed what happened in Baghdad that day, dismissed it as simply \u201cone bad day in a surge that was filled with such days,\u201d and then had the temerity to lavish praise on the unit in a book he called \u201cThe Good Soldiers.\u201d Julian is right to emphasize that the world is deeply indebted to patriotic truth-tellers like the sources who provided the gun-barrel footage and the many documents on Afghanistan and Iraq to WikiLeaks.",
    "\nWe hope to have a chance to honor them in person in the future.",
    "\nToday we honor WikiLeaks, and one of its leaders, Julian Assange, for their ingenuity in creating a new highway by which important documentary evidence can make its way, quickly and confidentially, through the ether and into our in-boxes.",

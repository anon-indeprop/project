    "SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case\n\nHey, remember five minutes ago when Pope Francis shouted at a reporter in Chile that there was \u201cno evidence\u201d supporting complaints against his good friend Bishop Juan Barros?",
    "\nAnd, just for good measure he accused the people accusing him \u2013 victims of sexual abuse by Barros\u2019 mentor, the convicted sex-predator Karadima \u2013 of committing \u201ccalumny\u201d?",
    "\n[1] And remember when Cardinal O\u2019Malley told the pope off in public over the \u201cpain\u201d these accusations had caused the victims of sexual abuse?",
    "\nAnd then remember how the pope had apologised-except-not-really because the accusations are, after all, still lies, and that there\u2019s still \u201cno evidence\u201d against Barros\u2026?",
    "\nThe press, secular as well as Catholic, is full this week of the story that the pope did indeed see evidence of Barros\u2019 complicity in Karadima\u2019s sexual abuse \u2013 not only that Barros had helped to cover it up but that he had been present and a direct witness at the time and therefore a passive participant.",
    "\nNicole Winfield and the Associated Press dropped the bomb that the information came directly from the victims, whom Francis had dismissed and refused to meet with on his trip, and delivered through his own Commission on sexual abuse:\nPope Francis received a victim\u2019s letter in 2015 that graphically detailed how a priest sexually abused him and how other Chilean clergy ignored it, contradicting the pope\u2019s recent insistence that no victims had come forward to denounce the cover-up, the letter\u2019s author and members of Francis\u2019 own sex- abuse commission have told The Associated Press.",
    "\n\nThe fact that Francis received the eight-page letter, obtained by the AP, challenges his insistence that he has \u201czero tolerance\u201d for sex abuse and cover-ups.",
    "\nIt also calls into question his stated empathy with abuse survivors, compounding the most serious crisis of his five-year papacy.",
    "\nNow it appears that Francis had also overruled a 2015 warning from the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith that Barros should not be made a bishop.",
    "\nThe Italian Catholic daily La Nuova Bussola Quotidiana reports that not only did the pope see a letter from victims, but that the CDF, under Muller, \u201chad already conducted an preliminary investigation into Barros and the other bishops close to Karadima which had led to the decision to relieve them of their duties.\u201d\n\u201cBut with a letter signed by the Pope in January 2015 and sent to the Chilean bishops, the request for exemption is blocked and shortly thereafter Barros is promoted to\u2026Osorno.\u201d\nThe article points out that while Karadima was convicted by a Vatican tribunal on the testimony of the victims, it is the same testimony of the same victim-witnesses that Francis now dismisses in the accusations against Barros.",
    "\nThe accusations that stood against Karadima come from the same sources as those against Barros, who the victims said was in the room watching at the time.",
    "\nWhile the specifics are still not known, readers may be reminded by this of a peculiar incident about a year later in which Pope Francis summarily ordered the dismissal of three priests of the CDF, whose remit was investigations of clerics accused of sexual abuse.",
    "\nThe website One Peter Five reports, via Marco Tosatti, that the pope ordered their removal without offering any explanation to then-cardinal prefect Gerhard Muller.",
    "\nWhen, after several attempts and three months later[2], Muller was able to get an audience with the pope to ask the reason, he received the response, \u201cI am the pope, I do not need to give reasons for any of my decisions.",
    "\nI have decided that they have to leave and they have to leave.\u201d\nMarco Tosatti reports the CDF incident, but it follows an odd story of a meeting of curial officials to discuss certain bishop appointments.",
    "\nWithout naming names, (or, frustratingly, giving dates[3]) Tosatti relates:\n\u201cIt was some time ago to make a bishop, not in Italy.",
    "\nThe nuncio has prepared the triad [the \u201cterna\u201d or list of three candidates].",
    "\nA cardinal, head of the dicastery, perhaps the same holder of the Congregation for Bishops, during the ordinary assembly took the floor, saying: \u2018The first candidate indicated is excellent, the second is good.",
    "\nBut I would like to warn of the third, whom I know well, since he was a seminarian, and who presents problems both on the level of doctrine and morality.",
    "\nHe responds little to the necessary criteria.",
    "\nBut the third was a friend of someone and another cardinal, of the circle currently in power, has flung himself at his colleague, accusing him of impropriety.\u2019 The meeting ended without further decisions.\u201d\nWhatever the details of these strange incidents, what is clear in Chile is that no amount of eyewitness testimony was going to make the slightest difference.",
    "\nBergoglio wanted Barros as a bishop and that was that.",
    "\nEven while \u201capologising\u201d the pope had doubled down when questioned about it by journalists, saying, \u201cYou, in all good will, tell me that there are victims, but I haven\u2019t seen any, because they haven\u2019t come forward.\u201d\n\u201cIn the case of Barros it\u2019s been observed, it\u2019s been studied; there\u2019s no evidence.",
    "\nThe best thing to do if someone believes it\u2019s the case is to come forward quickly with evidence.\u201d\nThe AP report, however, says exactly the opposite; that members of his own (now defunct[4]) abuse Commission had approached Cardinal O\u2019Malley, the pope\u2019s \u201ctop abuse advisor,\u201d with the letter to deliver to the pope.",
    "\nMarie Collins, the Irish abuse survivor and Commission member who resigned, citing the Vatican\u2019s refusal to take meaningful action, told AP, \u201cWhen we gave him [O\u2019Malley] the letter for the pope, he assured us he would give it to the pope and speak of the concerns.",
    "\nAnd at a later date, he assured us that that had been done.\u201d Juan Carlos Cruz, the Karadima victim whose membership on the Commission the Vatican had blocked, told AP, \u201cCardinal O\u2019Malley called me after the pope\u2019s visit here in Philadelphia and he told me, among other things, that he had given the letter to the pope \u2013 in his hands.\u201d\nOn the face of it, there are only a few logical possibilities here.",
    "\nIn fact, unless Cardinal O\u2019Malley \u2013 who has, as of this writing, remained silent \u2013 comes forward and says that he didn\u2019t hand the letter over pope, there is really only one; that the pope lied.",
    "\nAnd this is what is now being said quite openly by a vast array of voices, secular and Catholic, left and right.",
    "\nAs Winfield writes,\n\u201cThe revelation could be costly for Francis, whose track record on the abuse crisis was already shaky after a botched Italian abuse case he intervened in became public[5].",
    "\nMore recently, he let the abuse commission lapse at the end of last year.",
    "\nVatican analysts now openly question whether he \u2018gets it,\u2019 and some of his own advisers privately acknowledge that maybe he doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cNo evidence\u2026\u201d Lie big, lie often, and when caught, keep lying.",
    "\nOne of the many things these secular reporters seem not to be paying attention to is that \u201cno evidence\u201d is in fact a well-rehearsed, stock response for Bergoglio.",
    "\nHe said almost exactly the same in 2013 when confronted about another predatory homosexual he was sheltering.",
    "\nThe hoopla surrounding the \u201cWho am I to judge\u201d comment tends to obscure the context of the comment.",
    "\nIt was made in response to a question by a journalist about Monsignore Battista Ricca \u2013 a prelate whose promiscuous homosexuality is so well known it was covered by the Telegraph as early as July 2013.",
    "\nIlze Scamparini asked the pope about Ricca, saying, \u201cWhat you intend to do about this?",
    "\nHow are you confronting this issue and how does Your Holiness intend to confront the whole question of the gay lobby?\u201d\nWhat reply did Bergoglio give?",
    "\nHis standard one: \u201cNo evidence.\u201d\nAbout Monsignor Ricca: I did what canon law calls for, that is a preliminary investigation.",
    "\nAnd from this investigation, there was nothing of what had been alleged.",
    "\nWe did not find anything of that.",
    "\nThis is the response.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cIn this case, I conducted the preliminary investigation and we didn\u2019t find anything.\u201d\nBut Ricca\u2019s activities, for which the pope claimed there was no evidence, were notorious.",
    "\nThey include being caught in flagrante in an elevator with a teenaged male prostitute, and his sexual relationship with a captain in the Swiss army.",
    "\nSo flagrant was Ricca\u2019s behaviour that it took intervention by Uruguay\u2019s nuncio to have him removed.",
    "\nIt was reported in 1999 and 2000 by L\u2019Espresso, who said the information was confirmed by \u201cnumerous bishops, priests, religious and laity\u201d in Uruguay[6].",
    "\nIn fact, the evidence shows that Ricca is completely in line with Bergoglio\u2019s normal procedures.",
    "\nAs \u201cMarcantonio Colonna\u201d wrote in the Dictator Pope, \u201cIn fact his patronage of Monsignor Ricca fits the pattern which was well established when he was Archbishop of Buenos Aires, whereby he surrounds himself with morally weak people so as to have them under his thumb.\u201d\nIt was at this early \u201cno evidence\u201d comment on the plane home from Rio that some of those paying attention started to understand that Bergoglio\u2019s policy is in line with that of certain leaders of the past who recommended that if a politician was going to lie, he should lie big and lie brazenly.",
    "\nAnd in case anyone was wondering what will happen next, the same advice said to keep on lying after you\u2019re caught.",
    "\nThe pattern of silence and, when pressed, flat-out denial has been Bergoglio\u2019s policy since long before he came on the international scene.",
    "\nHe has a long record in Argentina of shaving close to scandals and vociferously denying involvement, and relying heavily on the broad good will of Catholics towards bishops to pull it off.",
    "\nPerhaps his biggest error with Barros was failing to understand just how little of that capital of trust there is left in the Catholic world as a whole.",
    "\nIndeed, on the subject of priests sexually abusing young people, it could only be measured in the negative numbers.",
    "\n\u201cArgentine Victims Who Tried to Meet with Pope Francis\u2026\u201d\nThough the website Bishop Accountability is blatantly anti-clerical, their data is unassailable since most of it comes from information that is already public.",
    "\nOn their Argentina page is a long list of accusations that Bergoglio/Francis simply isn\u2019t interested in hearing from victims.",
    "\n\u201cIn Pope Francis\u2019s 21 years as bishop and archbishop of Buenos Aires, the Wall Street Journal reports, including the years when he headed the Argentine bishops\u2019 conference, he declined to meet with victims of sexual abuse.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of them tried to contact the cardinal archbishop in 2002 or later,\u201d the same period when Pope Benedict and other bishops were striving to meet with victims and demonstrate an interest in the problem.",
    "\nThe site says that \u201cin addition to Bergoglio\u2019s failure to respond to victims, the public record contains no evidence that he released any information about abusers.\u201d\nIn fact, he went so far as to flatly deny there had been any instances of abuse in his archdiocese.",
    "\nWeeks after his election to the papacy, he was quoted by his close friend, Rabbi Abraham Skorka, \u201cIn my diocese it never happened to me, but a bishop called me once by phone to ask me what to do in a situation like this.\u201d Francis added that he agreed with the \u201czero tolerance\u201d attitude of the Irish episcopate and admired Pope Benedict\u2019s reforms \u2013 most of which he was later to quietly reverse.",
    "\nIt was at exactly this time, however, that victims from Argentina were attempting to get the new pope\u2019s attention.",
    "\nOne, known to the press only as \u201cGabriel,\u201d wanted to talk to Francis about the sexual abuse he suffered at the hands of Julio C\u00e9sar Grassi, accused of molesting at least five boys, \u201cwho has been avoiding the sentences of the justice of Mor\u00f3n and the Court of Cassation.",
    "\nSo far, judges and prosecutors at all instances found him guilty.\u201d\nIn case anyone thinks the Grassi-Gabriel case was not serious enough for the pope\u2019s attention, Bishop Accountability summarises, \u201cA year after Gabriel had filed criminal charges [2003] but before the start of Grassi\u2019s trial, three men ransacked the survivor\u2019s apartment and beat him.\u201d These men threatened to kill him if he did not retract his testimony and quit the case.",
    "\nTen years [after Gabriel filed criminal charges], in May 2013, with Grassi still free despite his conviction in 2009, \u201cGabriel and his attorney, Juan Pablo Gallego, brought a two-page letter addressed to Pope Francis to the office of the papal nuncio in Buenos Aires.",
    "\nAn employee refused to accept the letter after learning of its topic and threatened to call security if Gabriel and Gallego did not leave the premises.\u201d\nThe group surmises that it was Bergoglio\u2019s direct intervention with judges in the case that prevented a conviction against Grassi for so long and delayed his sentencing through multiple appeals.",
    "\nIn 2006, then-Archbishop Bergoglio complained of a \u201cmedia campaign\u201d and claimed that the Grassi case was \u201cdifferent\u201d from other accusations.",
    "\nDuring his criminal trial Grassi said Bergoglio \u201cnever let go\u201d of his hand.",
    "\nIn 2009, Grassi was convicted of two counts of aggravated sexual assault and corruption in the case of \u201cGabriel,\u201d who was aged 13 at the time of the abuse, but the appeals dragged on until he was finally sent to prison in September 2013.",
    "\nSeveral more similar cases, all of whom were rebuffed in their attempts to meet with Bergoglio, are detailed here, for the strong-of-stomach.",
    "\nA virtuoso performance-liar\nLooking back and carefully examining his record, Jorge Bergoglio\u2019s mastery of using the weaknesses of morally compromised men is becoming evident.",
    "\nIt is arguable that even the members of the so-called \u201cSan Gallen Mafia\u201d who apparently conspired to put him on Peter\u2019s throne were used by him.",
    "\nBut he is also a master of judging an audience and telling them what they expect to hear; a key skill for all grifters and confidence tricksters.",
    "\nLooking carefully at the infamous \u201cWho am I to judge\u201d comment, this was clear early on.",
    "\nThe first part of that interview is a blatant and enormous lie, and it was from there that the pope moved on to his apology for homosexuality in general.",
    "\nRecall that this was the very first airplane interview, on the trip back to Rome from World Youth Day in Rio, a matter of weeks after his election.",
    "\nAt the time, the papal apologists sprang instantly into action and we heard all about how the pope was talking strictly within the boundaries of Catholic doctrine.",
    "\nBut perhaps in hindsight, we are ready to examine the full implications of his little speech, one that was clearly well-rehearsed.",
    "\n(Don\u2019t forget, no question is asked in a papal interview without being thoroughly vetted ahead of time.",
    "\nJournalists must submit their questions well in advance.)",
    "\nThis was the pope laying out his policy regarding homosexuality, a policy for which he was duly rewarded by being lauded on the cover of the homosexualist lobby\u2019s US trade magazine.",
    "\nRead his full answer carefully:\nI see that many times in the Church, over and above this case, but including this case, people search for \u201csins from youth\u201d, for example, and then publish them.",
    "\nThey are not crimes, right?",
    "\nCrimes are something different: the abuse of minors is a crime.",
    "\nNo, sins.",
    "\n\nBut if a person, whether it be a lay person, a priest or a religious sister, commits a sin and then converts, the Lord forgives, and when the Lord forgives, the Lord forgets and this is very important for our lives.",
    "\nWhen we confess our sins and we truly say, \u201cI have sinned in this\u201d, the Lord forgets, and so we have no right not to forget, because otherwise we would run the risk of the Lord not forgetting our sins.",
    "\nThat is a danger.",
    "\n\nThis is important: a theology of sin.",
    "\nMany times I think of Saint Peter.",
    "\nHe committed one of the worst sins, that is he denied Christ, and even with this sin they made him Pope.",
    "\nWe have to think a great deal about that.",
    "\n\nBut, returning to your question more concretely.",
    "\nIn this case, I conducted the preliminary investigation and we didn\u2019t find anything.",
    "\nThis is the first question.",
    "\nThen, you spoke about the gay lobby.",
    "\nSo much is written about the gay lobby.",
    "\nI still haven\u2019t found anyone with an identity card in the Vatican with \u201cgay\u201d on it.",
    "\nThey say there are some there.",
    "\n\nI believe that when you are dealing with such a person, you must distinguish between the fact of a person being gay and the fact of someone forming a lobby, because not all lobbies are good.",
    "\nThis one is not good.",
    "\n\nIf someone is gay and is searching for the Lord and has good will, then who am I to judge him?",
    "\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church explains this in a beautiful way, saying ... wait a moment, how does it say it ... it says: \u201cno one should marginalize these people for this, they must be integrated into society\u201d.",
    "\nThe problem is not having this tendency, no, we must be brothers and sisters to one another, and there is this one and there is that one.",
    "\nThe problem is in making a lobby of this tendency: a lobby of misers, a lobby of politicians, a lobby of masons, so many lobbies.",
    "\nFor me, this is the greater problem.",
    "\nThank you so much for asking this question.",
    "\nMany thanks.",
    "\nOne of the pope\u2019s favourite rhetorical techniques is a combination of Begging the Question and conspiracy.",
    "\nHe starts by assuming, without any effort at defence or explanation, a point that concedes the whole issue.",
    "\nThis was the first time a pope had ever used the political term \u201cgay\u201d.",
    "\nNot \u201chomosexual,\u201d not \u201csame-sex attracted,\u201d but \u201cgay,\u201d meaning that he started by adopting the entirety of the homosexualist movement\u2019s linguistic manipulations.",
    "\nLanguage counts in politics, and a pope using that term means he is by implication starting the discussion \u2013 and his pontificate \u2013 by aligning himself with the basic tenets of a movement that is violently opposed to Catholic moral teaching, and in direct opposition to his immediate, and still living, predecessor.",
    "\nIn this case too, he was addressing a plane load of journalists who were either secular themselves, or for the most part are the kind of Catholic who believes it is fine to \u201cdisagree\u201d with Catholic teaching on sexuality.",
    "\nThere are very few \u201cconservative\u201d Catholics in the Vatican journalist pool.",
    "\nThis means that his use of this language was a conspiratorial wink and nod to his immediate audience, a sly message to say, \u201cPeople talk all the time about a gay lobby, but you and I both know this is mostly nonsense, propaganda from those people\u2026 those conservatives\u2026We cool and hip people don\u2019t hate gays, do we?\u201d\nThis astonishing departure follows an implied but very clear assertion that Ricca has repented and given up his activity, an assertion that has absolutely no evidence to back it up.",
    "\nWe are simply asked to take the pope\u2019s word for it, but given that it follows his astoundingly brazen lie that there was no evidence for Ricca\u2019s homosexual activity in the first place, we can take the assurance for what it seems to be worth.",
    "\nNext, after another little inside nudge-nudge-wink-wink joke about the \u201cgay lobby\u201d \u2013 implying (but of course never outright saying) that the whole thing is hysterical nonsense \u2013 we hear a direct contradiction to Catholic teaching from no less a source than his predecessor, Pope Benedict Ratzinger.",
    "\n\u201cThe problem is not having this tendency.\u201d Well, actually, your holiness, yes it is, particularly in the case of priests.",
    "\nThe \u201ctendency\u201d is called in the same catechism you quote \u201cintrinsically disordered\u201d and Ratzinger was very clear that this \u201ctendency\u201d is a sign of a serious emotional dysfunction that \u201cmust\u201d preclude a man from being ordained.",
    "\nSquandering the capital of trust\nA few months ago in a piece for the Remnant, I talked about why the Church (and nearly all human societies) regard lying as a sin:\nA mistake many make about lying is to understand it only in terms of morality.",
    "\nBut Thomas makes the point that it is first a matter of metaphysics.",
    "\nLying is an act at variance in its essence with the nature of reality.",
    "\nThomistic theology teaches that it is by lying that we become most like the devil, and most unlike God, because we are trying to change the nature of reality to suit our own purposes.",
    "\nHabitual lying in effect changes you into a different kind of being, one that is by nature an opponent of Truth, ordered against Truth.",
    "\nThis of course means that a person whose \u201corientation,\u201d as we might say, is towards falsehood, even when he is at any given moment saying something true, is still servicing his lies.",
    "\nHe tells the truth only to continue to control and manipulate reality.",
    "\nIt was not by violence, but by lying and manipulation, by issuing half-truths and pretending to be the kind of man he was not, that Shakespeare\u2019s character Iago earned the title of most evil character in English literature.",
    "\nHuman beings are naturally ordered towards the truth, and we have to work at assuming a lie.",
    "\nThis is why confidence tricksters can be successful, why lying works for getting what you want; people don\u2019t see it coming.",
    "\nThe first natural assumption is trust, at least at the basic level of expecting truth most of the time.",
    "\nWe therefore instinctively see lying as a betrayal of trust.",
    "\nConsidering how much trust the Catholic faithful had in the papacy until about 1965, how much un-earned trust Francis started with just by being elected, this pontificate should be remembered as one of the great confidence scams in history.",
    "\nBelieving Catholics have watched aghast as this pope has habitually trampled on every aspect of Catholic teaching.",
    "\nSandro Magister recently published a piece on his website that listed in dizzying detail the many times, in only the last few months, that pope Francis has falsified with obvious intention, the words of Christ in Scripture and the teaching of the Church.",

    "\nThis is the way societies disintegrate.",
    "\nIt has been said many times that the sex abuse crisis has created a massive loss of trust in prelates among the Catholic faithful, and this is true.",
    "\nWith a professional confidence trickster on the papal throne, blatantly using lies and manipulation to maintain power and ram through an agenda at radical variance with Catholic doctrine, how long before that predictable disintegration occurs?",

    "\nWith Cardinal Marx and others promoting \u201cblessings\u201d for \u201csame-sex unions\u201d are we going to be seeing an escalation of it?",
    "\nI have seen a veritable chorus of Catholics on social media declaring that if Paul VI is canonised, their loss of faith in the Church as an institution will be complete.",
    "\nI am told from contacts inside the Vatican that after the trip to Chile Bergoglio\u2019s support has completely dried up.",
    "\nHe has no more resources of trust even among the people he has chosen to surround himself with and after the reports of Cardinal Sandri going toe-to-toe with him in a shouting match, it seems that perhaps even his legendary vicious temper tantrums are failing to have the desired effect of terrorising his subordinates into submission.",
    "\nMarie Collins, by no stretch even a \u201cconservative\u201d Catholic, echoed this concern, saying the Barros affair has \u201cdefinitely undermined credibility, trust, and hope\u201d in Francis.",
    "\n\u201cAll I can say is that people who had a lot of hope in this particular pope, and I am talking about just ordinary Catholics that I know in my own parish, would find it very difficult now\u2026and cannot understand and cannot believe that this particular pope has said the things he has said in the last few weeks,\u201d she told the National Catholic Reporter.",
    "\nIt may seem like a moment to enjoy, seeing the apparently unbreachable shell of papal teflon finally cracking, but in reality this situation is potentially very harmful for souls in the long run.",
    "\nThere is a multitude of problems this pontificate has created or made worse that we will be dealing with for a long time after Bergoglio is gone, but perhaps one of the bigger ones will be the destruction of trust.",
    "\nAlready fractured since the collapse of all Catholic institutions after Vatican II and the horrors of the sex abuse crisis, how much will there be to repair of the once-steadfast trust Catholics instinctively had in the Church after this?",
    "\nNotes:\n[1] \u201cNot one victim has come forward in Chile; show me the proof.",
    "\nThis is slander and calumny.",
    "\nIs that clear?\u201d\n[2] The book \u201cThe Dictator Pope\u201d relates that regular meetings between the pope and dicastery heads have been abolished and even high-ranking curia prefects are often unable to see the pope, whose appointments are now completely controlled by the Secretariat of State.",
    "\nIt is certainly clear that no one sees the pope unless Cardinal Parolin approves, which may be the reason Cardinal Zen, in his efforts to warn Francis of the dangers of a Vatican deal with the communist Chinese government had to wait in the rain at a Wednesday general audience.",
    "\n[3] This is common in Italian journalism that has somewhat different standards from that of the Anglo world\u2026 and drives the rest of us spare.",
    "\nItalians care about getting a general picture of what\u2019s going on, where Anglo-Saxons are considered weirdly obsessed with trivial details.",
    "\n[4] Though she never blamed the pope, Marie Collins complained that Vatican officialdom had simply not implemented the Commission\u2019s recommendations.",
    "\nThe time limit of the Commission\u2019s members was allowed to lapse without renewal and though it was not dissolved formally the Commission has ceased to function with no word of any plan to revive it.",
    "\n[5] Probably a reference to the Inzoli case in which Francis overturned a previous sentence of a Vatican tribunal after the priest \u2013 now laicised \u2013 approached some of the pope\u2019s close advisors for help, including Cardinal Coccopalmerio.",
    "\n[6] Not that anyone in Rome was trying very hard.",
    "\nSandro Magister reported after the \u201cWho am I to judge\u201d comment, \u201cBefore the appointment, Francis had been shown, as is customary, the personal file on Ricca, in which he had not found anything unseemly.",

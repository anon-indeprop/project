    "SPECIAL REPORT: Pope Francis Accused of Inaction in Notorious Sex Abuse Cases\n\nThe incident was brief: on the Thursday of the pope\u2019s week-long South American trip, in response to an impromptu question tossed out by a Chilean reporter, the pope responded in what one reporter described as a \u201csnippy tone\u201d: \u201cThe day I see proof against Bishop Barros, then I will talk.",
    "\nThere is not a single piece of evidence against him.",
    "\nIt is all calumny.",
    "\nIs that clear?\u201d\nThis month has been quite a spectacle, even for this pontificate; an apparently unending stream of outrages and embarrassments, with the pope and his Vatican media support jumping from one scandal to the next.",
    "\nBut among secular reporters the sex abuse issue trumps all others and the fallout continues to blaze down on the Bergoglian pontificate in response to his amazing accusation earlier this month that victims of sexual abuse by clergy were engaging in \u201ccalumny,\u201d in their accusations against a Chilean bishop, Juan de la Cruz Barros Madrid.",
    "\nIt seems the shine is coming off the papal penny among leftist secular journalists, his natural constituency.",
    "\nWriting for the Boston Globe, the paper that first broke the clerical sex abuse scandals all the way back in 2001, Kevin Cullen wrote, \u201cLet the record show that the promise of Pope Francis died in Santiago, Chile, on Jan. 18, in the year of our Lord 2018\u2026 he has revealed himself like no one else could.\u201d\nBut it gets worse than this.",
    "\nWhen a \u201cleftist\u201d pope pressing a secularist agenda on the Church starts to lose the support of Michael Sean Winters and the National Catholic Reporter, he must know he\u2019s in trouble.",
    "\nThough he\u2019s \u201csticking with Francis\u201d for now, Winters wrote, \u201cI wish I knew what it was about Pope Francis that makes him fail to grasp the situation with Bishop Barros, the pain caused to the victims and the damage done to the church.",
    "\nI am gobsmacked that the pope twice declined to accept the bishop\u2019s resignation.\u201d\nOn January 23rd, an unsigned NCR editorial opined, \u201cWithin the space of four days, Pope Francis twice slandered abuse survivors.\u201d\n\u201cThese remarks are at the least shameful.",
    "\nAt the most, they suggest that Francis now could be complicit in the cover-up.",
    "\nThe script is all too familiar: Discredit the survivors\u2019 testimony, support the prelate in question, and bank on public attention moving on to something else.",
    "\n\u201cThe insistence with which Francis defends Barros is mystifying.",
    "\nThree separate journalists on the papal flight gave the pope opportunity to say why exactly he believed the bishop instead of the survivors accusing him.",
    "\nThe second journalist to ask Francis about Barros on the flight was a Chilean woman.",
    "\nAs she spoke to the pope, her voice cracked with nervousness at questioning the church\u2019s top leader.",
    "\nShe asked: \u2018Why are not the victims\u2019 testimonies proof for you?",
    "\nWhy do you not believe them?\u2019 The pope gave no satisfying answer, only repeating a claim of \u2018no evidence\u2019 against the bishop.\u201d\nIndeed, it was understood, as the Washington Post said, that Francis\u2019 trip to Latin America \u2013 dogged by protests over Barros both in person at the pope\u2019s appearances and in the press \u2013 was in part intended as \u201can apology tour\u201d to abuse survivors.",
    "\nWhich is why his accusation of calumny against those same victims the next day came as such a shock to observers unused to Bergoglio\u2019s ability to turn on a dime.",
    "\nAll was going as planned.",
    "\nOn Wednesday, January 17, the pope met as scheduled with selected survivors of sexual abuse by priests.",
    "\nHe made all the right noises, talking about his \u201cpain and shame,\u201d and reportedly even crying, at what happened.",
    "\n\u201cI know the pain of these cases of child abuse and I am following how much is needed to overcome this serious and painful evil,\u201d he said.",
    "\n24 hours later he was calling them liars.",
    "\nJames Hamilton, 49 and now a doctor, was one of the Barros accusers.",
    "\nHe told the BBC at a press conference, \u201cWhat the Pope has done today is offensive and painful, and not only against us, but against everyone seeking to end the abuses.\u201d The lead voice of the victims in Chile, Juan Carlos Cruz, tweeting to one of Francis\u2019s leading apologists, Austen Ivereigh, said, \u201cDoes he need a photo, a selfie, as proof?",
    "\nSorry Austen, we didn\u2019t think of it as we were being abused and Juan Barros watching.\u201d\nAlthough the issue came to the attention of a much broader audience during the most recent papal trip, the outcry has been ongoing since his appointment to the southern Chilean diocese of Osorno in 2015.",
    "\nBarros was a student prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of the charismatic homosexual/pederast predator Fernando Karadima, and went on to be ordained in 1984, made bishop in 1995 and appointed as bishop of the armed forces.",
    "\nBarros claimed in court that the first he knew of Karadima\u2019s offenses was on a Chilean television programme in 2010.",
    "\nThis is refuted by Karadima\u2019s victims \u2013 deemed credible both by the secular courts and the Vatican tribunal \u2013 who testified that he personally witnessed the abuse at Sacred Heart of Jesus church in Santiago.",
    "\nLast Thursday, however, was not the first time Francis, confronted unexpectedly in public over the Barros question, has responded testily and with insults.",
    "\nIn 2015 the Italian newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano published a video of him scolding two women who spoke with him in St. Peter\u2019s Piazza, asking that he reconsider the appointment, citing the \u201csuffering\u201d of the Church in Chile over the issue.",
    "\nThe pope told the women, \u201cThe Church has lost its freedom, letting its head fill with politicians and accusing a bishop without having any proof, after twenty years of service, so think with your head.\u201d He warned them not to allow themselves to be led by \u201cleftists who have set up this thing.\u201d\n\u201cThe only charge against this bishop has been discredited by the Court of Justice, so please do not lose your serenity, you suffer, but because you are foolish...I am the first to judge and punish those accused of similar crimes, but in this case there is not even a proof.\u201d\nThe insults were not forgotten.",
    "\nAmong the signs held by protesters in Chile last week were those reading, \u201cNi zurdos, ni tontos,\u201d (Neither lefties nor stupid).",
    "\nThe jab certainly wasn\u2019t lost on Francis, since the signs were being held by protesters the full length of his auto route to Santiago from the airport.",
    "\nOne of the protesters told the BBC, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t even know us, so how can he accuse us of being such things?",
    "\nHe thinks we are politically motivated even though we come from different parishes in Osorno and are doing this because we are against priests being allowed to abuse children.\u201d\nApparently His Holiness was informed that the \u201ccalumny\u201d comment had caused some blow-back because a couple of days later we got something touted \u2013 though somewhat skeptically \u2013 as a \u201ccontrite\u201d papal apology.",
    "\nThis also followed an astonishing public rebuke of the pope by Sean Cardinal O\u2019Malley \u2013 a member of the C9 council of cardinals and the former head of the pope\u2019s sex abuse commission \u2013 who said, \u201cIt is understandable that Pope Francis\u2019 statements yesterday in Santiago, Chile were a source of great pain for survivors of sexual abuse by clergy or any other perpetrator.\u201d\n\u201cPope Francis fully recognizes the egregious failures of the Church and its clergy who abused children and the devastating impact those crimes have had on survivors and their loved ones,\u201d O\u2019Malley said.",
    "\nOf course, Francis being Francis the apology was banked around with assertions of how right he was.",
    "\n\u201cI have to ask forgiveness because the word \u2018proof\u2019 wounded,\u201d he said.",
    "\n\u201cIt wounded many people who were abused\u2026I ask them for forgiveness because I wounded them without realizing it, but it was an unintended wound.",
    "\nAnd this horrified me a lot, because I had received them.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I know how much they suffer, to feel that the Pope says in their face \u2018bring me a letter, a proof.\u2019 It\u2019s a slap.",
    "\nAnd I agree that my expression was not apt, because I didn\u2019t think.\u201d\nHe doubled down, saying, \u201cI have not heard any victim of Barros.",
    "\nThey did not come, they did not show themselves, they did not give evidence in court.",
    "\nIt\u2019s all in the air.",
    "\nIt is true that Barros was in Karadima\u2019s group of young people.",
    "\nBut let us be clear: if you accuse someone without evidence with pertinacity, that is calumny.\u201d\n\u201cThis is what I can say with sincerity.",
    "\nBarros will remain there if I don\u2019t find a way to condemn him.",
    "\nI cannot condemn him if I don\u2019t have \u2013 I don\u2019t say proof \u2013 but evidence.",
    "\nAnd there are many ways to get evidence.",
    "\nIs that clear?\u201d\nThis \u201ccontrite\u201d papal apology didn\u2019t fly well even with the regular news reporters.",
    "\nPhilip Pullela, a reporter on the plane for Reuters, described it as \u201can extremely rare act of self-criticism,\u201d for the \u201cunusually contrite\u201d Bergoglio, and noted that, \u201cWhile the pope has vowed \u2018zero tolerance\u2019 for sexual abuse, his efforts have sputtered.\u201d\nIndeed, Francis claim that he met with and heard the \u201cpain\u201d of the victims is untrue in the specific case in hand.",
    "\nCBS News reports that though the Osorno group had tried to obtain a meeting during the trip they were refused.",
    "\nGreg Burke, the pope\u2019s press officer, confirmed that \u201cno papal meetings were planned with the Osorno group, which had formally requested to meet with the pope in July but were told by Vatican organizers that his schedule was already final, some six months before the trip.\u201d\nWho is Barros?",
    "\nSome may remember a video that made the internet rounds of an uproar in a Chilean cathedral at the installation ceremony of a bishop.",
    "\nAt the time it didn\u2019t draw much attention from the English language press \u2013 mostly at that time distracted by the ongoing battle of the notorious Kasper Proposal and the oncoming Synods.",
    "\nBut despite the pope\u2019s claim, the charges against Barros are serious and have been deemed credible by a judge.",
    "\nHe is accused of having covered up sexual abuse, including destroying evidence, committed by Karadima in the \u201880s and \u201890s.",
    "\nIn fact \u2013 and this point has tended to get glossed over in the press \u2013 Barros is accused by the victims of having been in the room, watching at the time, and of engaging in sexual activity with Karadima.",
    "\nThis is not, therefore, merely a matter of a bishop or colleague discovering the abuse after the fact, but of being a voyeuristic participant.",
    "\nJuan Carlos Cruz, told the press in 2015 that he and another boy \u2013 both in their teens at the time \u2013 \u201cwould lie down on the priest\u2019s [Karadima\u2019s] bed, one resting his head at the man\u2019s shoulder, another sitting near his feet.",
    "\nThe priest would kiss the boys and grope them, he said, all while the Rev.",
    "\nJuan Barros watched.\u201d Cruz, now a 51-year-old \u201cgay\u201d journalist, told The Associated Press, \u201cBarros was there, and he saw it all.\u201d\nA Vatican investigation found Karadima guilty in 2011 and sentenced him to a life of seclusion in a monastery for \u201cpenitence and prayer.\u201d Note that date; 2011 was when the processes for investigating and trying priest-abusers, put in place by the former Cardinal Ratzinger, were still in effect, and while he was still sitting on the Petrine throne.",
    "\nThings are a bit different now.",
    "\nNeither was the complaint against Barros without the support of responsible people.",
    "\nThe media reported that over 1,300 Catholic faithful in Osorno, including 30 priests of the diocese and 51 members of Parliament, wrote to the pope asking him to rescind the appointment \u2013 none of which received any response.",
    "\nFr.",
    "\nPeter Kleigel, a priest of Osorno, told Associated Press, \u201cWe\u2019re convinced that this appointment is not correct because, following canon law, a bishop must be well-regarded.",
    "\nWe need a bishop who\u2019s credible.\u201d\nThe problem with getting the news out about Karadima, as in most of these cases, was the bishop, in this case Cardinal Francisco Javier Err\u00e1zuriz of Santiago, who after the Conclave of 2013 was appointed a member of Pope Francis\u2019s C9 inner council.",
    "\nIt was certainly never a secret that Err\u00e1zuriz was a close, like-minded friend and collaborator of then-Cardinal Bergoglio, the kingpin of South American Catholicism.",
    "\nAllegations against Karadima \u2013 that went back to 1962 \u2013 had certainly been reported to Church authorities well before a Chilean news agency revealed the case in 2010, but were ignored by Err\u00e1zuriz.",
    "\nEven the National Catholic Reporter in 2014 pointed to the cover up and the relationship between the new pope and the accused cardinals,\n\u201cHamilton had applied for a marriage annulment, after telling his wife of a long psychosexual entanglement with Karadima that began when he was 17 in El Bosque.",
    "\nHis wife confided in a priest, who told Err\u00e1zuriz in 2006.",
    "\nWhen a canon lawyer and several priests close to the cardinal suggested that Hamilton not mention Karadima, he pressed on with his request in order to force the issue of punishment for the priest while having his marriage annulled.",
    "\nAgain, Err\u00e1zuriz refused to take action against Karadima.\u201d\nThe pope\u2019s claim that there is \u201cno evidence\u201d flies in the face of the ruling of the civil judge in the Karadima case \u2013 a fact that ought to be of paramount consideration under the Vatican\u2019s own rules for determining credibility in such cases.",
    "\nWhile Judge Jessica Gonzalez was forced to drop criminal charges because the statute of limitations had expired, she affirmed that testimony by Cruz and other victims was credible.",
    "\nAfter a full year of investigation, Gonzalez called their claims \u201ctruthful and reliable\u201d.",
    "\nVictims said that a letter written to Church authorities complaining of Karadima\u2019s abuse in 1982 was intercepted and destroyed by Barros, who was serving at the time as secretary to Cardinal Francisco Fresno, Err\u00e1zuriz\u2019s successor and collaborator.",
    "\nAs for Barros\u2019s general credibility as a Catholic bishop, the witness of the victims is damning.",
    "\nIn a letter to Bishop Ivo Scapolo, papal nuncio to Chile, that Cruz gave to the Associated Press, he said he witnessed Karadima and Barros in an intimate relationship.",
    "\n\u201cI saw Karadima and Juan Barros kissing and touching each other.",
    "\nThe groping generally came from Karadima touching Barros\u2019 genitals\u201d.",
    "\nBarros has never denied having had a close friendship with Karadima.",
    "\nHamilton confirmed this saying, \u201cI saw how Barros watched it all.\u201d\nAnd the matter didn\u2019t end in 2010.",
    "\nEmails published in Chile in 2015 showed that Cardinal Err\u00e1zuriz also blocked the appointment of Juan Carlos Cruz from the new child protection commission \u2013 a group plagued by such scandals and eventually ignored to death by Francis.",
    "\nWhich brings us to Francis Bergoglio\u2019s own record in this area.",
    "\nThe pope claimed \u201cI am the first to judge and punish those accused of similar crimes,\u201d but this claim is not supported by the reality.",
    "\nIndeed, it has been pointed out that Francis has gone to considerable lengths to dismantle the efforts of his predecessor at \u201csafeguarding\u201d young people, punishing abusers and removing bishops who cover it up.",
    "\nIn the case of Barros, the Associated Press obtained a confidential letter from Pope Francis dated 2015 that \u201creveals the [Chilean] bishops\u2019 concern about Francis naming a Karadima prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Bishop Juan Barros.\u201d Just days before the pope\u2019s \u201ccalumny\u201d comment, January 11, AP reported that Francis had full knowledge of the controversy he risked in appointing Barros to Osorno.",
    "\n\u201c[H]is ambassador in Chile had tried to find a way to contain the damage well before the case made headlines.\u201d\nThe letter, addressed to the executive committee of the Chilean bishops\u2019 conference, said, \u201cThank you for having openly demonstrated the concern that you have about the appointment of Monsignor Juan Barros.",
    "\nI understand what you\u2019re telling me and I\u2019m aware that the situation of the church in Chile is difficult due to the trials you\u2019ve had to undergo.\u201d The letter said that in 2014 the nuncio, Archbishop Scapolo, had asked Barros to resign as bishop of the armed forces and had \u201cencouraged him to take a sabbatical year before assuming any other pastoral responsibility as a bishop.\u201d\nThere can also be little doubt the new pope was fully aware of the record of his close friend Cardinal Err\u00e1zuriz in ignoring complaints of Karadima\u2019s victims when he appointed him to the C9 council.",
    "\nAnd even if he didn\u2019t then, he certainly knows now, and yet Errazuriz continues in that advisory role.",
    "\nFrancis further appointed Cardinal Err\u00e1zuriz to serve as his Special Envoy to World Apostolic Congress Of Mercy III meeting in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia in June 2014.",
    "\nSince 2001, Cardinal Ratzinger and later as Pope Benedict installed effective procedural reforms on clerical sexual abuse; Francis in his short five years has all but completely dismantled or reversed those changes.",
    "\nAmong the earliest indications Catholics had that the new pope had no intention of getting to the bottom of the priest-abuser problem was his appointment of the notorious homosexual, Monsignor Battista Ricca, as head of the Vatican Bank and the man in charge of his own residence, the Casa Santa Martha.",
    "\nIt is often forgotten that Bergoglio\u2019s notorious comment \u201cwho am I to judge\u201d was in response to a question on a plane-presser about Ricca, and was followed with a similar claim from Francis about there having been no proof of his misbehaviour.",
    "\nAs the pseudonymous Marcantonio Colonna wrote in the book, \u201cThe Dictator Pope,\u201d \u201cIn fact his patronage of Monsignor Ricca fits the pattern which was well established when he was Archbishop of Buenos Aires, whereby he surrounds himself with morally weak people so as to have them under his thumb.\u201d\nBut even before this was the sinister appearance of Godfried Cardinal Danneels on the loggia on the night of Francis\u2019s election to the papacy.",
    "\nDanneels\u2019s prominence in the Bergoglian pontificate continues to be the most prominent indicator of the pope\u2019s deprioritising of clerical sexual abuse.",
    "\nThe former head of the Brussels archdiocese was a leading figure in the so-called St. Gallen Group, which he himself described as a \u201cmafia,\u201d who had worked against the election of Joseph Ratzinger in 2005 and to elect Bergoglio in 2013.",
    "\nAt the end of a long career as Europe\u2019s leading \u201cliberal\u201d Catholic prelate, Danneels came under a cloud of scandal when he was accused of having covered for a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 bishop who admitted to having sexually abused his own minor nephew.",
    "\nIn 2010 the publication of an audio recording determined undeniably that Danneels had told the victim to keep quiet and not cause trouble for the soon-to-retire Bishop Roger Vangheluwe of Bruges.",
    "\nThe cardinal even went so far as to suggest that the victim should \u201cask forgiveness\u201d for his own role in the scandal.",
    "\nBefore the recordings were released, Danneels had also denied all knowledge of sexual abuse by clergy or cover-ups.",
    "\nIn the book, Colonna asks the question, \u201cWhat happened to \u2018Zero Tolerance\u2019 for clerical sexual offenders?\u201d He wrote that data presented by the Vatican the UN Human Rights Commission in January 2014 showed that Benedict XVI \u201chad defrocked or suspended more than 800 priests for past sexual abuse between 2009 and 2012,\u201d including the notorious Fr.",
    "\nMaciel Degollado, founder of the Legionaries of Christ.",
    "\nCrucially, it was Ratzinger who moved the competence for sex abuse cases from the Congregation for Bishops to Doctrine of the Faith, with powers to suspend and punish offenders.",
    "\nHis reforms specifically included bishops who had refused to act against priest-abusers.",
    "\nA senior member of the Vatican\u2019s diplomatic corps, Archbishop Miguel Maury Buendia, confirmed this, saying, \u201cThis Pope has removed two or three bishops per month throughout the world...",
    "\nThere have been two or three instances in which they said no, and so the Pope simply removed them.\u201d\nThese reforms \u2013 and removals \u2013 have ceased entirely under Francis.",
    "\nDespite his claims that he punishes the guilty, it was in fact Francis who reversed the previous, Benedict-era sentence against the notorious Italian priest-pederast Mario Inzoli at the request of the now-equally notorious Cardinal Coccopalmerio.",
    "\nInzoli was found guilty in 2012 by an ecclesiastical court of abusing boys as young as twelve and suspended.",
    "\nInzoli had even abused boys in the confessional, convincing them that the abuse was approved by God.",
    "\nFollowing an appeal by Coccopalmerio, Francis reduced the priest\u2019s penalty to a \u201clifetime of prayer,\u201d with permission to say Mass privately, and a promise to stay away from children.",
    "\nThe uproar over this caused the Italian prosecutors to reopen the case against the priest, and eventually Inzoli went to prison and was laicized.",

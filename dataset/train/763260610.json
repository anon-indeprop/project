    "The Eerie Silence\n\nIn a recent communication between Randy Credico, an Assange supporter, comic and radio producer, and Adam Schiff, the ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee, Assange\u2019s fear of arrest and extradition to the US was confirmed by the leader of the Russia-gate frenzy.",

    "\nThe United Nations Working Party on Unlawful Detentions has made that clear.",
    "\nBritain took part in an investigation which determined that Julian was a political refugee and that a great miscarriage of justice had been imposed on him.",

    "\nThey realize that WikiLeaks has done what they should have done a long time ago, and that is to tell us how governments lie.",
    "\nDB: One thing that disturbs me greatly is the way in which the Western corporate press speculate about Russian involvement in the U.S. 2016 election, that it was a hack through Julian Assange.",
    "\nAny serious investigator would want to know who would be motivated.",
    "\nAnd yet the possibility that it might be the dozen or so pissed-off people who went to work for the Clinton machine and learned from the inside that the DNC was all about getting rid of Bernie Sanders\u2026this is not a part of the story!",

    "\nThere was something highly emblematic about that for me.",
    "\nHe stood up to challenge the fact that the CIA was about to hand over leadership to a person who had been in charge of torture.",
    "\nIt is both shocking and surreal, which of course the Julian Assange case is as well.",
    "\nBut real journalism should be able to get through the shocking and the surreal and get to the truth.",
    "\nThere is so much collusion now, with all these dark and menacing developments.",
    "\nIt is almost as if the word \u201cjournalism\u201d is becoming blighted.",
    "\nDB: There has certainly been a lot of collusion when it comes to Israel.",
    "\nThen the word \u201ccollusion\u201d is quite appropriate.",
    "\nJP:That\u2019s the ultimate collusion.",
    "\nBut that\u2019s collusion with silence.",
    "\nNever has there been a collusion like the one between the U.S. and Israel.",
    "\nIt suggests another word and that is \u201cimmunity.\u201d It has a moral immunity, a cultural immunity, a geopolitical immunity, a legal immunity, and certainly a media immunity.",
    "\nWe see the gunning down of over 60 people on the day of the inauguration of the new U.S. embassy in Jerusalem.",
    "\nIsrael has some of the most wickedly experimental munitions in the world and they fired them at people who were protesting the occupation of their homeland and trying to remind people of the Nakba and the right of return.",
    "\nIn the media these were described as \u201cclashes.\u201d Although they did become so bad that The New York Times in a later edition changed its front page headline to say that Israel was actually killing people.",
    "\nA rare moment, indeed, when the immunity, the collusion was interrupted.",
    "\nAll the talk of Iran and nuclear weapons is without any reference to the biggest nuclear power in the Middle East.",
    "\nDB: What would you say have been the contributions that Julian Assange has made in this age of censorship and cowardice in journalism?",
    "\nWhere does he come into the picture?",
    "\nJP:I think it comes down to information.",
    "\nIf you go back to when WikiLeaks started, when Julian was sitting in his hotel room in Paris beginning to put the whole thing together, one of the first things he wrote was that there is a morality in transparency, that we have a right to know what those who wish to control our lives are doing in secret.",
    "\nThe right to know what governments are doing in our name\u2014on our behalf or to our detriment\u2014is our moral right.",
    "\nJulian feels very passionately about this.",
    "\nThere were times when he could have compromised slightly in order to possibly help his situation.",
    "\nThere were times when I said to him, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just suspend that for a while and go along with it?\u201d Of course, I knew beforehand what his answer would be and that was \u201cno.\u201d The enormous amount of information that has come from WikiLeaks, particularly in recent years, has amounted to an extraordinary public service.",
    "\nI was reading just the other day a 2006 WikiLeaks cable from the U.S. embassy in Caracas which was addressed to other agencies in the region.",
    "\nThis was four years after the U.S. tried to get rid of Chavez in a coup.",
    "\nIt detailed how subversion should work.",
    "\nOf course, they dressed it up as human rights work and so on.",
    "\nI was reading this official document thinking how the information contained in it was worth years of the kind of distorted reporting from Venezuela.",
    "\nIt also reminds us that so-called \u201cmeddling\u201d by Russia in the U.S. is just nonsense.",
    "\nThe word \u201cmeddling\u201d doesn\u2019t apply to the kind of action implied in this document.",
    "\nIt is intervention in another country\u2019s affairs.",
    "\nWikiLeaks has done that all over the world.",
    "\nIt has given people the information they have a right to have.",
    "\nThey had a right to find out from the so-called \u201cWar Logs\u201d the criminality of our wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.",
    "\nThey had a right to find out about Cablegate.",
    "\nThat\u2019s when, on Clinton\u2019s watch, we learned that the NSA was gathering personal information on members of the United Nations Security Council, including their credit card numbers.",
    "\nYou can see why Julian made enemies.",
    "\nBut he should also have made a huge number of friends.",
    "\nThis is critical information because it tells us how power works and we will never learn about it otherwise.",
    "\nI think WikiLeaks has opened a world of transparency and put flesh on the expression \u201cright to know.\u201d This must explain why he is attacked so much, because that is so threatening.",
    "\nThe enemy to great power is not the likes of the Taliban, it is us.",
    "\nDB: And who can forget the release of the \u201ccollateral murder\u201d footage by Chelsea Manning?",
    "\nJP: That kind of thing is not uncommon.",
    "\nVietnam was meant to be the open war but really it wasn\u2019t.",
    "\nThere weren\u2019t the cameras around.",
    "\nIt is indeed shocking information but it informs people, and we have Chelsea Manning\u2019s courage to thank for that.",
    "\nDB: Yes, and the thanks he got was seven years in solitary confinement.",
    "\nThey want to prosecute Assange and maybe hang him from the rafters in Congress, but what about Judith Miller and The New York Times lying the West into war?",
    "\nThere is no end of horrific examples of what passes for journalism, in contrast to the amazing contribution that Julian Assange has made.",

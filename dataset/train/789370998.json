    "The Left\u2019s Show Trial for Kavanaugh\n\nTwo more women accusing Judge Brett Kavanaugh of dubious improprieties materialized out of thin air late Sunday, throwing Senate Republicans\u2019 hope of finally confirming the Supreme Court nominee this week even more into doubt.",
    "\nThe new allegations came yesterday amid reports that Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) tentatively scheduled a hearing for this Thursday to take testimony from Christine Blasey Ford, 51, who claims Kavanaugh, 53, sexually assaulted her decades ago when he was a high school student.",

    "\nAfter stalling Grassley and getting repeated extensions, the attorneys got the chairman to cave on various demands, such as that Kavanaugh not be in the room when Ford gives evidence.",
    "\nRepublicans never seem to learn from their mistakes.",

    "\n\u201cThe kids love it and the ones who don\u2019t participate aren\u2019t made to feel left out.\u201d\n\nBut the plaintiffs in the suit and their backers argue that the program\u2019s popularity shouldn\u2019t matter in the face of Supreme Court rulings such as McCollum v. Board of Education in 1948 that have banned public schools from initiating or sponsoring religious activity.",
    "\nThe suit alleges that the lessons in the Mercer schools are similar to what a child would hear in Sunday school and that they advocate the Ten Commandments and treat stories in the Bible as historical fact.",

    "\n\nDeal said she joined the suit because she believes strongly in the separation of church and state.",
    "\n\u201cWhen something is wrong,\u201d she said, \u201cyou have to stand up against it.\u201d\nGod is a big deal in Mercer County, home to about 125 churches that dominate the main streets of its biggest towns, Princeton (population 6,400) and Bluefield (10,400), and smaller burgs such as Athens (1,000), Bramwell (360) and Oakvale (120).",
    "\nA lot of the good jobs in the county have left \u2014 22 percent of its 61,000 residents live below the poverty level \u2014 but the churches have stayed.",

    "\nThe church, one of the largest buildings in town, can hold up to 2,000 people for Sunday services and often does.",
    "\nFor Hurt, Bible in the Schools, which has been in the public schools here in one form or another since 1939, is simply a way for students to further their knowledge.",
    "\n\n\u201cThere is a great deal of not just poetry and prose in the Bible, but from what I\u2019ve read almost every piece of history that\u2019s in the Bible has eventually been proven,\u201d he said.",
    "\n\u201cWe see the Bible not just as a book of faith but as a pretty accurate account of history that informs us about a lot of things that happened.\u201d\n\nHurt, whose son, the Rev.",
    "\nJ.B. Hurt, is also a minister in the Church of God and a member of the county school board, says he would oppose the program if he thought it was being used to teach religion or if students were required to take the class.",
    "\nBut he also embraces the idea that the Bible offers irrefutable lessons in morality and teaches the difference between right and wrong.",
    "\n\n\u201cIf you read the Bible, you\u2019re going to get a whole lot of good ideas that are going to stick with you and make you a better person,\u201d he said.",
    "\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to push religion with it.",
    "\nIt speaks for itself in terms of morals and ethics and those things.\u201d\nThe idea that a weekly Bible class for 6,600 students in 16 public elementary schools and three middle schools is somehow simply an academic offering doesn\u2019t sit well with Lynne White, 54, a former two-term school board member and mother of two sons who went through Mercer schools.",
    "\n\n\n\u201cAs a person of faith myself, I don\u2019t see any problem with having an after-school Bible program,\u201d White said.",
    "\n\u201cBut to me this seems a pretty clear violation of the Constitution.\u201d\n\nWhite holds the school board and leadership responsible for spreading what she says is a false sense of what the Bible in the Schools program is and does.",
    "\n\nIn a commentary for the Charleston Gazette-Mail, White wrote that \u201cthe Bible in the schools program in Mercer County is being sustained on a foundation of lies.\u201d\n\nShe argued that the classes are character education based on biblical values, that they were not electives because West Virginia doesn\u2019t offer electives in elementary or middle school and that even though the classes are funded by private donations, that doesn\u2019t mean they should be taught during the instructional day.",
    "\nShe also said it was untrue that children who didn\u2019t take the class weren\u2019t made to \u201cfeel different or ostracized.\u201d\nWhen White posted the article on Facebook, she heard from some supporters, but many others questioned her faith.",
    "\n\u201cI will pray for you and all non-believers Lynne White.",
    "\nGod Bless!",
    "\n!\u201d one wrote.",
    "\n\nAnother wrote:\n\n\u201cLynne White You are not a Christian, a Christian is a person who strives to be more Christ like with everything they do and I do not believe Christ would be working to shut this program down or alter it to include your worldly views.\u201d\nIf it were simply a popularity contest, Bible in the Schools would be allowed to continue as is.",
    "\nEven the president of the local mosque in Princeton says it should stay.",
    "\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to be God-fearing no matter how you approach it,\u201d said Mohammad Iqbal, head of the Islamic Society of the Appalachian Region.",
    "\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s the Bible, whether it\u2019s Koran, whether it\u2019s Torah, whether it\u2019s some other book.",
    "\nBut it should be optional, not enforced.",
    "\nIf the parents have no objection and the student has no objection, it is okay.\u201d\n\nBut the program\u2019s fate will not be resolved by popular vote or on Facebook posts.",
    "\nInstead, the question will be tried in the courtroom of Judge David A. Faber of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia in Bluefield.",
    "\n(Faber was nominated by President George H.W.",
    "\nBush.)",
    "\n\nRepresenting the Mercer school district is the First Liberty Institute, a nonprofit law firm based in Texas that specializes in religious freedom cases.",
    "\nHiram Sasser, a lawyer at the firm, said the district\u2019s main objective is to allow the Bible course to remain as an elective while making sure it complies with the law.",
    "\nThe district filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on Wednesday.",
    "\n\n\u201cThere are two things to look at,\u201d Sasser said.",
    "\n\u201cThe first is whether you can have a Bible course at all.",
    "\nAnd the other is whether you can have the Bible course as it is presently constituted.",
    "\nIt\u2019s fair to say that we\u2019re very confident on the first issue.",
    "\nAnd on the second issue .",
    "\n.",
    "\n.",
    "\nour client is very, very flexible in terms of making sure that the content is in compliance with the law.\u201d\n\nBut the plaintiffs aren\u2019t looking for flexibility.",
    "\nThey want the Bible class out of the school day.",
    "\nThe program \u201cis unconstitutional at its core and cannot be saved via modifications,\u201d said Patrick Elliott, a lawyer with the Freedom From Religion Foundation.",
    "\n\u201cThere is no legally permissible way for Mercer County Schools to continue with any type of program like this.\u201d\n\nAccording to Elliott, the Mercer program is \u201cextremely rare\u201d and there are only a handful of districts around the country with similar courses.",
    "\nThe amended complaint, Elliott said, seeks to prevent the school system from \u201corganizing, administering, or otherwise endorsing Bible classes for Mercer County Schools\u2019 students in grades kindergarten through eighth grade.\u201d\n\nCharles C. Haynes, the founding director of the Religious Freedom Center at the Newseum in Washington, doesn\u2019t foresee the program surviving a court challenge in its current form.",
    "\n\n\u201cThis is a loser for the school district,\u201d Haynes said.",
    "\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to satisfy the First Amendment in elementary school when it comes to the Bible.",
    "\nStudents at that age really aren\u2019t prepared to tell the difference between what is history and what is religious conviction.\u201d\n\nHaynes argues that people of faith are doing their religion a disservice when they try to have it taught by a government entity.",
    "\nThey would rightly object, he said, if they lived somewhere where they were the religious minority and supporters of another religion wanted a course on their faith taught in public schools.",
    "\n\n\u201cEven if 99.9 percent of the people in the community want it, they need to remember that liberty of conscience is not up for a vote,\u201d he said.",
    "\n\nTrenton Tolliver is oblivious to the Bible battle that swirls around him.",
    "\nHis first-grade school year ends next month.",
    "\nHanging in the balance of the court case is what he will learn in the Bible course in second grade.",
    "\nOr if there will be a Bible course at all."

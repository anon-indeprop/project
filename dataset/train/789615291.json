    "\nThe last-minute accusations from Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who claims that decades ago Kavanaugh groped her at a high school party, and Deborah Ramirez, who accused Kavanaugh of exposing himself to her at a frat party at Yale, are transparent acts of aggression against the judge and Republicans, one engineered by the Democrats.",

    "\nPeople who knew Ramirez after her time at Yale say that she never once mentioned the incident \u2014 until Kavanaugh's nomination was pending.",
    "\nNo law enforcement agency, let alone the FBI, would waste its time with an allegation of a crime decades in the past, and so patently incoherent and lacking in evidence.",
    "\nThe \u201cFBI investigation\u201d is another delaying tactic.",
    "\nFord has finally agreed to testify, set for Thursday for now.",
    "\nBut it\u2019s unclear whether Grassley has granted Ford any of her preposterous conditions for testifying: She will take questions from the Committee, but not from outside lawyers, who might not be as gentle as politicians with one eye on the polls.",
    "\nOnly one camera can be in the room.",
    "\nKavanaugh must testify first, a grotesque inversion of our bedrock principle that an accused has the right to confront his accuser\u2019s charges.",
    "\nHe can\u2019t be in the room with her, apparently because she\u2019s still traumatized and may start experiencing flashbacks.",

    "\nIf Ford actually testifies on Thursday, or Ramirez is granted the same concession, nothing material will be gained.",
    "\nHer accusation will not be proved true or false.",
    "\nWe will learn nothing about Kavanaugh that makes him any less eminently qualified for the Supreme Court, nothing that can add to the thousands of pages of documents already presented to the Committee, or the hundreds of hours of the judge\u2019s testimony before rabid partisans and office-seekers.",
    "\nBut vetting Kavanaugh\u2019s qualifications isn\u2019t the point.",
    "\nThe point is to delay confirmation by slandering Kavanaugh and baiting the Republicans into appearing to abuse victims of sexual assault.",
    "\nWhy?",
    "\nFacing his likely confirmation, the Dems, egged on by the mainstream media\u2013\u2013especially The New Yorker, which published a story too badly sourced even for The New York Times\u2013\u2013 are desperately attempting to obstruct and delay the process until after the midterm elections, when they hope they will retake the Senate and thus stop any more Constitutionalist judges from being confirmed to the Court for the rest of Trump\u2019s term.",
    "\nThe Democrats have stooped so low with these smears because they know the stakes.",
    "\nThe courts and especially the Supreme Court have been critical to the progressives\u2019 program since Woodrow Wilson.",
    "\nThe biggest obstacle to the progressive dream of government controlled and managed by a technocratic oligarchy has been the Constitution.",
    "\nIts divided and balanced powers were designed precisely to rein in overreaching ambition and concentrations of power.",
    "\nHence the Constitutional order must be subverted by the Supreme Court and its unaccountable justices enjoying lifelong tenure.",
    "\nBut if Kavanaugh is confirmed, there will be five reliably Constitutionalist justices on the bench, who are unlikely to tolerate judicial usurpation of Congress\u2019s law-making powers.",
    "\nThat\u2019s why this current nomination is a hill the Dems are willing to beclown themselves on.",
    "\nGiven how obviously partisan and hypocritical this ploy is\u2013\u2013doesn\u2019t Keith Ellison\u2019s accuser deserve to be heard and believed too?",
    "\n\u2013\u2013why has Grassley so far allowed himself to be played by the Dems?",
    "\nBecause Republicans fear the backlash from all those women voters who presumably agree with the fundamentalist feminists, and insist that every accusation of sexual assault, no matter how much it\u2019s unsupported by corroborating evidence or even plausibility, must be believed.",
    "\nThis contention itself is an expression of the radical feminist narrative of innate male feral sexuality that makes them sexual predators.",
    "\nThe irony is that today\u2019s feminists have been willing to sacrifice the earlier narrative of female power and agency that had been stifled by traditional views of the sexes and their capabilities.",
    "\nInstead, now women are Victorian hothouse flowers too delicate to make their way through their lives without the paternal federal government protecting them with its coercive power.",
    "\nWomen have exchanged one form of dependence, and one double standard for another.",
    "\nThe Dems are using Ford and Ramirez as part of the Democrats\u2019 transparently dishonest delaying tactics because they know that most Republicans have accepted this duplicitous feminist narrative and fear challenging it.",
    "\nEspecially after the recent spate of sexual assault charges\u2013\u2013many of them true, some false, others contested\u2013\u2013 politicians consider bucking the narrative to be as politically suicidal as proposing to reform Social Security and Medicare.",
    "\nIt\u2019s the new third rail of American politics, one that transcends party affiliation.",
    "\nHence the widespread virtue-signaling on the part even of conservative writers who preface their comments about Ford and Ramirez with prologues full of truisms about how horrible sexual assault is, how its self-proclaimed victims \u201cmust be heard,\u201d and how churlish and sexist it is to question the truth of any charge.",
    "\nGrown-ups know all that and don\u2019t have to be reminded every time the subject arises.",
    "\nThe Dems know that most Republicans come to this conflict with the huge disadvantage that results from accepting your opponent\u2019s dubious ideology and dishonest narrative.",
    "\nThe progressive party can dare the Republicans to ignore the endless specious demands, stop the show-trial, and proceed to a vote on Kavanaugh, because they know the Republicans, fearful of the \u201coptics,\u201d will cave.",
    "\nThey know that the eleven male Republican Senators on the Judiciary Committee dread the #MeToo movement casting them as knuckle-dragging Neanderthal sexists who want to \u201csilence\u201d the accuser with their \u201ccavalier treatment of a sexual assault survivor,\u201d as one Ford lawyer has said.",
    "\nRepublicans still don\u2019t get that no amount of appeasement will stop the left from demonizing them anyway.",
    "\nJust ask Boy Scout Mitt Romney, who was savaged for his innocuous \u201cbinders full of women.\u201d\nAnd don\u2019t forget, the old sorta, kinda moderate Democrats like Feinstein and Chuck Schumer, who now have joined the crowd of trendoid socialists armed with torches and pitch-forks, will go along because they\u2019re frightened of their party\u2019s increasingly rabid left-wing base.",
    "\nWhat can we do to end these confirmation circuses?",
    "\nJust stop holding them.",
    "\nThere\u2019s nothing in the Constitution that says the Senate\u2019s power to give \u201cadvice and consent\u201d to the president regarding his nominee must entail days of televised hearings replete with caterwauling protestors and grandstanding Senators who\u2019ve already made-up their minds.",
    "\nInvite written questions from the Senate, then schedule one day for the nominee to respond.",
    "\nDon\u2019t put it on television, but make public a written transcript.",
    "\nRemove the television cameras, and attention-craving, politically ambitious Senators will be gone like a cool breeze.",
    "\nFor now, Grassley needs to end this farce if Ford doesn\u2019t show up on Thursday or continues to negotiate for more delays and concessions.",
    "\nNo more concessions.",
    "\nNo more delays.",
    "\nNo more ceding control of the process to Democrat Party lawyers.",
    "\nDon\u2019t give Ramirez the time of day.",
    "\nHold the vote no later than Thursday, or Friday if Ford does show up.",
    "\nMake Senators go on the record with their votes, and hold them to account in November.",
    "\nPut to the test the Dems\u2019 claims that a critical mass of women, many of them with sons they don\u2019t want falsely accused, believes the fundamentalist feminist narrative and will vote accordingly.",
    "\nTo borrow Churchill\u2019s definition of appeasement, stop feeding the alligator in the hopes that you will be eaten last.",
    "\nFor fifty years the Democrats have proven they will demonize conservatives as racist and sexist no matter how often they bow and scrape.",
    "\nHow about acting on principle for a change and shoot the alligator."

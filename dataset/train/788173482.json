    "\n\u201cThe action he has taken, to direct your agencies to selectively disclose classified information that he believes he can manipulate publicly to undermine the legitimacy and credibility of the Special Counsel\u2019s [Robert Mueller] investigation, is a brazen abuse of power.\u201d\nThe missive is signed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Sen.
